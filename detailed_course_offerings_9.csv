SDES4205,Term 2 2019,"Art & Design, Paddington",1,0,"This course examines the issues which affect the communication and presentation of information in disciplines which employ text, data and graphics. With the advent of discoveries, inventions and improvements in computer and communication technologies our society is increasingly being expected to deal and cope with vast amounts of information in the form of text and images, as well as sound, in the case of multimedia applications. The dissemination of information can now be achieved much faster than traditional print media via the digital environment. Access to the processing and promulgation of information is also made possible through the availability of computer equipment and software packages which are now priced reasonably within the financial reach of many individuals. This democratisation of information access has produced a profound impact on how information is being generated, packaged and communicated to society. The increased proliferation of unintelligible and uncommunicable information in both the print and electronic media, and cyberspace is a pertinent case in point.

The practice is an important part of current visual communication where the surreal is used to convey ideas and emotions alongside traditional moving image, photographic and animation techniques.
The course aims to develop a wider practice from skills that you have learned in earlier coursework. We start by firming your knowledge of digital imaging from still sources. We will then extend these techniques to moving elements and explore the added complexity this brings. Lastly we will move our compositions into three dimensions and gain experience with animation that tracks motion also drawn from the real world. Through these exercises you will develop skills that can assist your further explorations within photo media and moving image. Lectures will cover the history of visual effects across painting, photography, the pre-moving image and film. You will learn how meaning can be conveyed by manipulation of existing imagery.
The course is of use to all students in video, imaging, and animation, and particularly useful for those wishing to combine animated and real world imagery.",L2 Animation Prerequisite,6 Units of Credit

We begin from the understanding that policy-making is political in nature because the distribution of power among and between the groups and individuals involved is unequal. Therefore, as we study policy making as a political process we highlight the fact that making policy involves conflict and cooperation; struggles for power, influence and authority; and includes groups and individuals both inside and outside government.
The course will examine both the problems and methods of decision-making in the modern state from the perspective of a range of differently situated 'policy workers'.

SWCH9032,Term 2 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"This course designed for postgraduate study aims to provide up to date information on perinatal psychology.


The arrival of a baby into a family is an intensely emotional experience. If new parents are able to support one another and negotiate the challenges of becoming a family, it is a time for learning and growth. For some families, however, this experience is fundamentally challenging and coping well with the changes remains elusive.
The transition to parenthood is widely acknowledged as a period of great change. It is also a time of increased psychological vulnerability. Although emotional upheaval is normal, the vulnerability of this period can have important consequences from the standpoint of the mother and father, their infant, and their family. The phenomenon of perinatal depression in parents is well recognised. In Australia, 29% of women are likely to develop a depressive or anxiety disorder in the first 6-8 months postpartum. There is also a growing body of evidence showing that infant growth and development can be influenced by the psychological health of his or her parents.
This six module course explores the psychological processes associated with pregnancy and the first year postpartum. The course covers a range of topics, from the psychology of pregnancy, to bonding and attachment, mood disorders in the perinatal period, infant psychological growth and development, and interventions to support parents, infants and families who experience difficulties. The course focuses not only on evidence-based practice, but also the latest research findings and their implications for future clinical and research initiatives in the field.
