This course introduces students to fundamental aspects of criminal justice and process. Woven through the course is a critical examination of the interaction between the criminal justice system and the criminal law: specifically, that application of the law is shaped by and dependent on decisions made by criminal justice actors including police, prosecutors and judicial officers. Specific areas of focus include: why some activities are criminalised and others not; the use and misuse of discretion; the impact of the reliance on summary justice; the significance of pre-trial processes such as search, arrest and bail; and the over-representation of Indigenous people and other vulnerable groups.

Crime and the Criminal Process also introduces the doctrinal building blocks of criminal law, and applies these principles to a number of key statutory offences such as public order offences and drugs offences which illustrate the process themes above. The impact of public policy and law reform is an important underlying theme.

This course follows from LAWS1021 / JURD 7121 Crime and the Criminal Process, and applies the perspectives and themes of that course to the doctrinally central criminal offences and defences. These are examined in a contextual framework that emphasises the policy and social issues underpinning the development and application of the law. This critical approach allows students to appreciate a complex set of conflicting ideologies, principles, discretion and histories informing the criminal law. The course draws on materials from other disciplines – especially criminology, history, sociology and feminist theory, which enhance students’ appreciation of the law in context. Social issues including race, class and gender are stressed. Comparisons with jurisdictions other than NSW are undertaken where this highlights relevant policy issues, legislative alternatives, or demonstrates the contingent nature of the law in question. Throughout, detailed doctrinal analysis of the chosen offences/defences takes place and students develop the skills of legal element analysis of both statutory and common law offences and defences.

This course is worth 6 units of credit. It complements, and is studied in the same session as, LAWS1124 - Lawyers and Society.
 
CFLS develops students’ understanding of the functioning of the legal system and facility with foundational legal skills that students acquired in LAWS1121 – Legal System and Skills A. Students are introduced to fundamental concepts and legal paradigms in three core areas of substantive law: contract; tort and criminal law. The course focuses on students’ acquisition of legal problem-solving skills in both oral and written contexts to enhance students’ understanding of legal principles found in case and statute law in these three fields. It provides preparation for, and an introduction to, the study of Contract, Tort and Criminal Law in the LLB program.
 
Module 1: Contract
A good grounding in the basic principles of contract law is a fundamental element of any legal education. This Module is an introduction to the study of voluntarily assumed legal obligations which govern many important areas of daily life. This Module focuses on students acquiring a sound understanding of a number of basic principles of contract law, through common law method, with particular focus on the elements required for the formation of a valid contract, namely offer and acceptance; consideration; intention to create legal relations; certainty and privity.
 
Module 2: Criminal Justice
The aims of the Criminal Justice module are to introduce students to foundational elements of the criminal law, and some key issues related to criminal justice. The course will include an examination of the components of criminal offences generally, and will take two substantive offences (murder and offensive language/behaviour) to see how these elements play out in practice.
 
Module 3: Tort
This module covers the part of the law of torts which signifies, broadly speaking, the law determining liability to pay compensation for wrongfully caused injury, damage or loss through medical negligence.
The prime objective is to introduce students to the core principles of negligence, including a critical understanding of the policy considerations informing the law. A second objective of this course is to examine a relatively limited number of leading cases and legislation in selected areas and thereby develop skills of analysis, synthesis and evaluation. A third objective is to encourage students to consider the way in which the law of torts operates in the context of society as a whole, and the ways in which it is influenced by such particular factors as insurance, social security, and the need (or absence of a need) to ascribe fault. Thus there is a theoretical component to the course which introduces various debates about the nature and effectiveness of tort law.","Prerequisite: Academic program must be 7016, Humanities Pathway Program.",6 Units of Credit

This course introduces students to the study of public law, including its history, institutions, methods of reasoning and fundamental principles. Students will acquire an understanding of the introductory principles and theories of administrative and constitutional law as they apply to the essential features of the Australian system of government, and their implications for human rights and the rule of law. The course exposes students to this material through an examination of Australia’s hybrid constitutional inheritance from the United Kingdom and United States, as adapted in the creation and subsequent development of the federal Commonwealth. In doing so it also examines the implications of colonisation for Indigenous legal systems and assertions of Crown sovereignty. The role, powers and interrelationship of the three arms of government are considered in contemporary as well as historical context, as are the issues of rights protection and constitutional change. The course prepares students for their later study of the courses LAWS1160: Administrative Law and LAWS2150: Federal Constitutional Law, and also introduces students to the fundamentals of the skill of statutory interpretation in the public law context.

This course introduces students to the basic elements and principles of private law. It begins by looking at what the term private law means, the sources of private law and how the different areas of private law - especially property, contract, tort and unjust enrichment – relate to each other.
The bulk of the course is spent on the topics of contract and property law. In both cases, the course provides an introduction to materials that are expanded upon in later subjects. With respect to contract law, this course covers the formation of contracts and the doctrine of privity. Several other elements of contract law are dealt with later in the curriculum in Contracts. With respect to property law, this course considers the boundaries of the concept of property, as well as several of the rules with respect to the creation, transfer and protection of property rights. Again several other elements of property law are dealt with later in Land Law, and to some extent also in Equity and Trusts.
The course also introduces students to two smaller topics: agency and equitable estoppel. As well as being closely related to contracts and property, these are two important areas of law for practicing lawyers.

LAWS1230,"Term 1 2019, Term 2 2019, Term 3 2019","Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"Lawyers, Ethics & Justice is a compulsory core course in applied legal ethics. It examines the structures, rules and values that enable ethical practice for lawyers. The course explores ethical issues that arise in professional practice and the regulations and standards that govern them. It considers these issues and principles in light of our personal values, experiences and psychological biases, as well as wider and dynamic professional contexts. These contexts include the history and workings of the legal profession and its rapidly changing circumstances. They also include the diverse and demanding environments in which contemporary lawyers work. 
This course treats questions of ethics as found in everyday decisions and behaviour, general as well as those particular to lawyers. However, Lawyers, Ethics & Justice addresses, in particular, the responsibilities of lawyers in maintaining the integrity of the justice system. In doing so, students will analyse the roles lawyers do and should play in the justice system, and relate them to the values and routine skills lawyers have, or should have, to ensure effective and just outcomes. 
The course is also designed for students to evaluate the conduct of lawyers, the nature of ethical practice, and the pursuit of justice in light of their own identities, values and skills. Students are asked to consider what acting in accordance their values would mean for their own professional lives. 
During the course, students will start to develop the skills they will need to engage in ethical legal practice, including those to: identify and address ethics issues; work with colleagues and other professionals to institute and maintain ethical work practices; recognise and manage the diverse needs and interests of clients; and integrate often competing duties to clients, the workplace, the profession, the judicial system and society. This course combines interactive teaching, group work, and a clinical component in which students work with clients and lawyers at UNSW Law's Kingsford Legal Centre.

This course continues students’ exposure to the field of public law, to which they have been earlier introduced in LAWS1141: Principles of Public Law. In LAWS2150 students engage with the intellectual debates surrounding methods of constitutional interpretation, before embarking on a study of the scope of specific Commonwealth legislative powers of importance in the contemporary operation of Australia’s federal system. The course also examines the effect of express and implied constitutional limitations upon the powers of government – particularly those which protect civil and political rights. Understanding of the scope of valid legislative action is developed through application of propositions of constitutional law to actual and hypothetical legislative instruments.

Law in the Global Context is a core course that responds to the changing nature of law in Australia and around the world - namely the increasing interdependence of legal systems and the infusion of international law into Australian law and institutions.  The course introduces students to various areas of law having an international dimension, in particular public international law, private international law, comparative law and transnational law. It will concentrate on key themes and emerging trends in these areas through case studies and in depth consideration of the law in action. It will also specifically introduce students to the interaction of 'global law' with the different branches of Australian law studied in other compulsory courses.  The course will instil in students an appreciation of the essential notions that underpin international, transnational and comparative law, such as sovereignty, private international law, and transplantation of law.  Students will additionally undergo a series of tutorials on researching and writing about law in a global context.",Prerequisite:Completion of 78 UOC in LAWS courses including Equity and Trusts (LAWS2385).

LAWS2320,"Term 1 2019, Term 2 2019, Term 3 2019","Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"This course encourages students to take a reflective interest in the study of law - its intellectual foundations, its social conditions, its relationships with morality and politics, and its kinship with other disciplines, especially philosophy, ethics and social theory. The course is theoretical in the following sense.  In their practical, day-to-day, activities, lawyers take, and must take, much for granted: about the nature of the law, about the purposes and functions of its institutions and doctrines, and about the worth of it all.  They practise within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules.  Customarily they think within the categories and arrangements provided by the legal system, rather than about them. 
 
Legal Theory is concerned to think about precisely those frameworks that lawyers think within.  It aims to probe and discuss theoretical questions about law, which underlie the practical stuff of the law.  Such questions include matters of description and analysis - what's going on?; of comparison - what else goes on elsewhere and what can it tell us about what goes on here? - and of evaluation - is what is going on what should be going on? Purported answers to such questions are constantly assumed and relied upon in legal talk and action. Legal actors, however - like all social actors - are frequently unaware of the extent to which, or the ways in which, what they take to be perfectly obvious, natural and impossible to imagine otherwise reflects particular, usually traditional assumptions which are questionable but are rarely questioned.
 
Legal theory examines such assumptions, clarifies the issues with which they are concerned and frequently shows these issues to be more puzzling and contentious than is commonly assumed.  It acquaints students with, and gives them opportunities to think about, question, criticise and defend, some of the most important ingredients in their own thought about the law; ingredients which are all the more important for not being commonly recognised as matters of argument or even discussion at all. 

Theoretical inquiry has no predetermined 'results', or rather just one. Students will decide for themselves whether they emerge from such inquiry with better or worse reasons to believe what they started with, or whether they should believe new or different things. On the other hand, however they begin, they are unlikely to emerge thinking that the questions discussed in the course have simple, obvious or uncontroversial answers.
 
In general terms this course discusses the consequences for law of the present ascendancy of two basic ideas – legal positivism as a dominant approach to understanding law and liberalism as an organising framework for thinking about political life. Legalpositivism, basically, is the idea that the validity of law is a matter that can be worked out independently of non-legal (e.g. moral) concerns. A liberal understanding of politics among other things takes the conception of ourselves as self-governing (as autonomous) as its basic value and evaluates legal practices in terms of how well or badly they contribute to this value. Time is spent discussing these accounts of law and politics.

Along the way we discuss a number of basic ideas associated with contemporary legal/moral/political philosophy. These include - the nature of legal analysis, the separation of law from other areas of social life, the difference in moral theory between the right and the good, moral and personal autonomy, liberalism’s relationship to rights and to cultural and religious difference, and law’s relationship to justice, democracy and the rule of law.
 
In order to make these ideas more concrete we relate them to certain ‘problems’ of contemporary legal practice.",Pre-requisite: 24 UOC completed in LLB courses or 24 UOC completed in Juris Doctor courses. Juris Doctor students who commenced prior to 2013 need no pre-requisites.,6 Units of Credit
LAWS2326,"Term 1 2019, Term 3 2019","Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"This course seeks to understand the nature of law and justice and, in particular, the relationship between the two, in contemporary society. The point of departure will be a consideration of the character of justice. Since this is an enduring philosophical question, posed differently at different times, it will be approached historically. We examine what some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present-day have understood about the nature of justice. The focus will be not only on explaining and critically analyzing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law.
Not only will the course analyse different theories of justice, but it will also put the ideas, gained through such analysis, to work by considering a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, what are the criteria of justice and how in modern circumstances might we ground these? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice? Is any interpretation of law always based on an understanding of legal justice? And what are we to make of various claims to justice, for instance, international justice, intergenerational justice, historical or transitional justice?

Court Process, Evidence and Proof provides students with an analytical study of the law of evidence and civil and criminal court processes. These topics are examined in their legal, ethical and socio-psychological dimensions. The course approaches these topics by first exploring the legal and factual elements that define evidence law. In the criminal context, the course additionally explores prosecutors’ ethical and legal obligations to the court and to the defendant. From this preliminary framework students examine key principles, rules and institutional elements associated with the formal adjudication of legal disputes. Australia’s uniform evidence legislation provides the major doctrinal focus of this course. Its institutional focus centres on the role of participants in the court process. The course aims to foster in students critical analytical skills and values consistent with aspirational ideals of professional and ethical legal practice. These goals are pursued by observational fieldwork, audiovisual aids, occasional guest speakers, readings and the engagement of students in classroom discussion that is aimed at developing their understanding of the complexities and challenges evidence law and court processes create for litigants, lawyers, witnesses and decisionmakers. In addition, the course pays particular attention to ensuring students fully appreciate the important rights of criminal defendants and the protections afforded to them in court.

The resolution of civil disputes requires legal practitioners to be equally competent in invoking the court system or employing negotiation, mediation or arbitration. The course addresses civil procedure which governs the steps involved in initiating, conducting, managing, terminating, enforcing or appealing the outcome of, legal proceedings in a Court. Specific attention is paid to jurisdiction, case management, pleadings, discovery and costs. The course provides an introduction to Alternative Dispute Resolution, in particular, negotiation, mediation and arbitration. The course examines the advantages and disadvantages of each dispute resolution procedure and the factors that influence when they should be utilised from both policy and practice perspectives. The course also explores principles of adversarial litigation that inform the rules, both in content and in practice, and ethical issues that the resolution of disputes creates for lawyers.

This course introduces students to the doctrines of equity and the law of trusts. It traces the historical development of equity and its relationship with common law. Students will critically consider the appropriate application of a range of equitable doctrines to particular scenarios and the availability of different remedies. Students will also be introduced to the law of trusts and, in particular, the nature of a trust, legal requirements in establishing a trust as well as the rights, duties and powers associated with trusts. The course assumes familiarity with equitable doctrines taught in Principles of Private Law and Contracts (alternatively Contracts 1 and 2), for instance estoppel, undue influence, unconscionability. For students who have not completed Principles of Private Law, the course will include a transitional module on personal property to introduce subject matter that was previously taught in Property, Equity and Trusts and will in future be taught in Principles of Private Law.

LAWS3046,"Term 1 2019, Term 2 2019","Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"This course, together with Intellectual Property 2: Trade Marks and Patents, collectively consider Australian intellectual property (IP) law.
IP—which encompasses the laws of copyright, designs, patents, breach of confidence, passing off and registered trade marks, as well as various related doctrines—has become one of the most important areas of commercial legal practice in recent years. It is vital to the marketing, advertising, entertainment, communications and science and technology industries. The two courses together aim to introduce students to each of the general law and statutory protections outlined above. For each of the heads of protection, the courses gives detailed consideration to the subject matter which is protected, the pre-conditions for protection, and the nature of infringement. Various justifications for IP are also considered, particularly in the context of new or developing forms of IP.
Intellectual Property 1: Copyright and Designs considers two key aspects of Australian IP law. The first, which is the focus of the course, is the law of copyright. Copyright primarily protects creative and entrepreneurial subject matter such as books, art, music, films and TV broadcasts. The course focuses on key issues such as the history of and justifications for copyright; copyright subject matter; requirements for subsistence; ownership and exploitation; infringement, defences and remedies; and moral rights. Attention will also be paid to emerging debates, policy issues and law reform proposals on such issues as the impact of digital technology, rights in entertainment franchises and indigenous artists’ rights. The second aspect of IP law considered in the course is registered designs, with a focus on requirements for registration, infringement, and the techniques used to manage the overlap between copyright and design protection.
Intellectual  Property 1 and Intellectual Property 2 can be taken in any order.
Please be aware that students who take Intellectual Property 1 and/or Intellectual Property 2 will not be able to take LAWS3021 Foundations of Intellectual Property Law and/or LAWS3057 Advanced Intellectual Property Policy and Practice. Similarly, students who take Foundations of Intellectual Property Law and/or Advanced Intellectual Property Policy and Practice will not be able to take either Intellectual Property 1 or Intellectual Property 2.

This course will examine theses two state bills of rights, and their likely future interpretation in light of both existing case-law and comparative experience in jurisdictions such as the US, Canada, South Africa nad the UK. The course will also explore the broader theoretic  stakes behind these interpretive questions, ongoing debates about the potential amendment of these charters (so as, for example, to include more extensive socioeconomic rights protections) and the adoption of a rights charter at a national level.

LAWS3057,Term 1 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"This is a course for students who have already learned the fundamentals of intellectual property law, and who would like to extend their knowledge and practical skills in this area of law.
Policy: The course provides opportunities to explore some contentious areas of debate and policy development within intellectual property law, such as trade mark counterfeiting and copyright piracy; issues surrounding bio-prospecting and ownership of genetic material; protection of indigenous cultural and intellectual property (‘ICIP’); and the effects of intellectual property laws on access to essential medicines.
Practice: The course also examines practical issues intellectual property lawyers are likely to confront in practice, such as franchising; the interplay of marketing, branding and trade marks; portfolio management; criminal offences; registration practice and strategies; parallel importation; geographical indications. A choice of assessment options allows students to either extend their knowledge in a particular area of interest through a research essay, or develop their practical legal skills by advising hypothetical clients in a series of short problem question exercises known as ‘practice briefs’.
The course provides a solid general knowledge of relevant issues and skills for students wishing to practice in intellectual property law, and a good grounding in intellectual property research for students considering writing a thesis or undertaking postgraduate studies in this area.

LAWS3070,Term 2 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"Investment treaties are among the most powerful and controversial instruments of international economic governance. They grant foreign investors broad protections from interference by the governments of the countries in which they invest. They also establish an international mechanism for adjudication and enforcement, allowing foreign investors to bypass national courts and, instead, bring cases against states directly to international arbitration. The amount at stake in these disputes regularly runs into billions of dollars. Philip Morris’ recent case against Australia arising from Australia’s tobacco plain packaging legislation is a high profile example. Supporters argue that investment treaties promote foreign investment and respect for the rule of law in countries that are bound by them. Critics argue that investment treaties constitute a ‘bill of rights for multinational corporations’ that is enforced through ‘secret courts’. 
This course provides an introduction to the law and policy of the investment treaty regime. The course covers the network of almost 3000 bilateral investment treaties, along with the investment chapters of multi-issue free trade agreements, such as NAFTA and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. It also covers international dispute settlement through investment treaty arbitration under the ICSID and UNCITRAL Rules. Topics covered include:
-          The range of foreign investors and foreign investments covered by investment treaties;
-          Key substantive protections contained in investment treaties, such as guarantees of ‘fair and equitable treatment’, non-discriminatory treatment and compensation for expropriation;
-          Rules and procedures governing investment treaty arbitration;
-          International enforcement of arbitral awards.
All topics are illustrated with practical examples drawn from the 700 known investment treaty arbitrations conducted to date.
The course also encourages students to engage with the central policy debates relating to the investment treaty regime, including:
-          whether governments fully understood the implications of investment treaties when they signed them;
-          whether investment treaties deliver economic benefits promised by their proponents;
-          how the goal of protecting foreign investment should be balanced with governments’ need to regulate in the public interest;
-          how investment treaties relate to other regimes of investment governance, such as investor-state contracts, national law and investment insurance.
The course is relevant to:
-          students considering a career in international dispute settlement, whether in private practice or as a government lawyer;
-          students seeking to understand the interaction between national and international legal regimes governing international economic activity;

In addition, given the influence and role of the United States in the world, American legal concepts, ideas and approaches are often borrowed or considered by non-American courts and legislatures as they develop their own law. But, successful transplantation is difficult, but made easier through a knowledge of the borrowed legal system and a corresponding ability to then critically evaluate the value and utility of any proposed transplantation.

It looks at particular areas of development not only for their own sake but also as indicators of the changing role of law in Chinese society. Areas which are the subject of particular attention include: the elements and institutions of Chinese legal system; the role of law in Chinese society from the perspectives of legal history and philosophy; contract law; intellectual property law; foreign investment law; corporate and securities law; foreign trade law and mediation, arbitration and civil enforcement procedures.

LAWS3131,Term 1 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"The course focuses on legal and regulatory aspects of the Internet and related technologies. It covers topics of concern to individuals as well as business and government, including protection of intellectual property in a digital environment, electronic contracts, computer and information security, and cyber crime.  
The interaction between traditional law and modern technology plays a central role in the course. In order to analyse the impact and application of traditional legal principles in a new technological environment, the principles must be translated into the language of the technologies involved. The translation must preserve the original meaning and policy rationale. It is the aim of the course to teach, encourage and nurture such thinking. Examples of problems we shall encounter and analyze in the course include the connection between enabling technologies of cyber crime and the contours of liability of cyber criminals and their enablers; how an understanding of the Internet informs whether notice of electronic contractual terms is properly provided by a hyperlink; and determining whether an implied term of fitness for purpose can be read into a contract to download software.
A statement by Professor Lawrence Lessig captures the essence of the course: “[w]hen dealing with cyberspace, judges are to be translators; different technologies are the different languages; and the aim is to find a reading of [legal principles] that preserves [their] meaning from one world’s technology to another. This is fidelity as translation.”[1] Lawyers who fail to understand the translation will likely pursue sub-optimal litigation strategies, face speculative recovery prospects, and may overlook effective and potentially powerful defences.

LAWS3149,Summer Term 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"This unit explores the emerging complexity of the relation between Law and Biology in the 21th century. It examines the following question: What does the concept ""biology"" do in legal descriptions of events in the world. Law not just regulates, allows, or limits what can be done or undone biologically but it also defines or alters our philosophical, political or social self-understanding. Both law and biology are meaningful structures which define, diagnose, and create concepts of persons as ""nature"", ""bodies"", ""organism"", ""groups"" or ""life"" (to name just a few). ""Law and Biology"" aims to provide a historical, analytical, and critical reflection on the legal implications of biological or biologized legalities.
The unit complements other units offered at the law school such as Legal Theory, Law and Social Theory, and Theories of Law and Justice. Similarto these units, Law and Biology has an emphasis on theoretical and critical aspects of the topic and relates law to an interdisciplinary field of knowledge and legal practices. The unit also relates to units such as Law and Medical Health or Intellectual Property Law which connect law with the biomedical or biotechnological field. The main difference with the theory electives is that Law and Biology takes place in an entirely different context, the field of biology, and that its focus is on theorizing law in the contemporary world where biolegitimacy increasingly takes hold. The difference with the other units is that the Law and Biology unit does not focus on matters of litigation. Instead, it opens up a broader and theoretical horizon both in the ways law itself can be understood and how it is connected to biology and science as a method. This connection will be explained through historical, analytical and legal insights and will include reflections on the scientific and ethical questions this relation provokes in the contemporary legal system. 
Students wishing to think about law “outside the box"" and who are interested in developing a rich theoretical and interdisciplinary perspective on law combining insights from philosophy, biology, technology, sociology, neurology, psychology and ethics will surely enjoy this course. It is recommended that students have some knowledge in legal theory through having taken one of the legal theory prescribed electives before enrolling in this course. No pre-existing knowledge of biology is necessary.

The course explores the different sanctions/remedies available to regulators and private parties to assess their suitability to deal with particular scenarios.
The first part of the course will focus on analysing the different regulatory responses taken by regulators such as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority to deal with corporate (including financial) breaches of the law. This will pave the way toward studying the benefit/disadvantages of the tools available to the regulators. The second part of the course will then explores the advantages/disadvantages of private and public actions in the context of corporate breaches.
The course allows the students to evaluate the different outcomes that result from public and private actions. During the course, students will start to develop a better understanding of the different options available to regulators and private parties to deal with corporate breaches of the law and the impact that one action may have on the other.
This course combines interactive teaching, group work and exploration of relevant topics and theoretical frameworks that are of key interest to students.
The course is particularly suitable for students interested in careers in corporate and commercial litigation, criminal law and enforcement or corporate in-house roles.

LAWS3181,"Summer Term 2019, Term 3 2019","Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"One of the most important areas of international law is the law regulating recourse to and the use of force. It is a unique body of law comprising two separate and distinct bodies of rules: the jus ad bellum, which is the law governing the legality of the resort to force, and the jus in bello, which is the law regulating the conduct of hostilities. The jus in bello is also referred to as humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, or the laws of war. The law of armed conflict is a body of rules that was developed to protect the most vulnerable groups during armed conflict and to mitigate the deleterious effects of the methods of warfare.
The course is designed to provide an overview of the fundamental principles of the law of armed conflict (or international humanitarian law). It will place international humanitarian law within public international law more generally, and delineate its relationship to other areas of international law (such as the international law of human rights). Specifically, the course will cover the principles and rules relating to the protection of individuals during armed conflict, as well as rules relating to the means and methods of warfare, including weapons issues. We will also explore issues relating to the implementation and international and national enforcement of international humanitarian law.

The first part of the course focuses on the 1951 Refugee Convention, including who qualifies for refugee status, the protections afforded to refugees and the procedures for refugee status determination. The second part of the course considers the capacity of the current international legal framework to respond to displaced persons who do not fall within the Refugee Convention, such as internally displaced persons, persons fleeing human rights abuses or civil war, and those whose movement is a result of climate change or environmental catastrophe. The course considers the theoretical underpinnings of the international forced migration regime and queries why States have agreed to protect certain categories of persons and not others, and whether this is legally and/or ethically sound.
This course considers the legal obligations of States and international organisations to assist and protect forced migrants. While the focus of the course is on international law responses to issues of forced migration, consideration will also be given to the relationship between the international legal regime and domestic law.

LAWS3196,Term 3 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"This course will teach students how to design legal information systems, integrating expert systems, hypertext, text retrieval and other technologies, for use in generating legal documents from precedents and assisting users to navigate solutions to legal problems. After learning the necessary skills, students will work in small groups, in partnership with a not-for-profit centre or organisation, to design and build a legal information system.
In class, students will also be exposed to a variety of examples of automation of legal tasks, and the various legal and practical issues associated with their use, including issues of professional regulation. This will include guest lectures from those working on legal expert systems and related technologies. Students will also become familiar with theoretical approaches to legal information systems development, and the range of technologies and approaches that may contribute to applications development.
Designing legal information systems requires students to think through a class of legal problems in a structured way. Systems can be used to generate legal documents from precedents, with variations based on the responses of a user, as well as to answer legal questions within a particular field. They are one component of the increasing tendency to automate legal tasks. Used well, legal information systems can facilitate access to legal information and expertise, but always within the limits of their designer's foresight. Designing a good legal information system thus requires skills in legal analysis and problem-solving, as well as the ability to think creatively and explore different approaches to a problem.
This course does not require students to have any pre-existing skills or experience in expert systems or computer programming - the course itself includes instruction on how to use expert system software.

A minority of the world’s population grow food, and in highly urbanised countries that minority is vanishingly small. Less than 0.01% of Australians are employed in agriculture of any kind. Modern agriculture is industrialised and food production corporatized. However, across the globe, there is a growing movement to reconnect with food production and to critically examine how food reaches our tables. Researchers and food activists are highlighting the social, cultural, ethical and environmental costs of modern food production, and exploring alternatives to industrial food systems.
This course will introduce students to a broad range of legal and policy issues, at both domestic and international level, that relate to food. Drawing on the expertise of multiple teachers, topics may include:
Regulatory models that affect food production and distribution, including international covenants on food security and food aid, environmental laws, patents, trademarks, cultural heritage laws, biotechnology and health standards, animal rights, consumer laws and local government/planning law;
Biotechnology and food production, including the demise of historical prohibitions on agricultural patents and public interest litigation around patenting life forms; the distinction between discovery and invention and its consequence; the distinction between open-pollenated seeds, hybrids and GMOs; contemporary developments in agribusiness and biotech patenting; plant variety rights; seed saving and farmers’ rights;
The environment and food, including the environmental impact of nutrient and pesticide pollution, biodiversity loss and deforestation, water overuse, carbon emissions and waste; legal and regulatory regimes designed to respond to these challenges, illustrated through case studies such as the pollution of the Great Barrier Reef by agriculture run-off; the regulation of water use in agriculture (70% of the world’s water) and in the food chain (two thirds of our total water footprint), including legal rights to surface and groundwater, water planning, allocations, efficiency approaches, markets, pricing and enforcement;
Aboriginal science and rights to food, including an Indigenous Knowledges perspectives on science, agriculture and property rights to water, land, plants and animals, and data sovereignty; the regulation and use of this knowledge, including global initiatives around biopiracy; access and benefit sharing agreements; creative commons licensing; traditional knowledge databases; regional WIPO initiatives;
Diverse legal models of enterprise in the food sector, particularly those that link production and distribution in innovative ways; the intersection between the sharing economy and the food system; the potential for innovative domestic models to help realise food-related international Sustainable Development goals;
Urban agriculture, including the challenges of reconnecting overwhelmingly urban populations with food growing and production; legal rights to access land through public and private law; grassroots activism, community groups, allotments and guerrilla gardening, in Australia and overseas.
Interactive classes on a range of issues will give students a broad understanding of laws and policies that relate to food.  Classes may vary from term to term, depending on staff availability.

IP—which encompasses the laws of copyright, designs, patents, breach of confidence, passing off and registered trade marks, as well as various related doctrines—has become one of the most important areas of commercial legal practice in recent years. It is vital to the marketing, advertising, entertainment, communications and science and technology industries. The two courses together aim to introduce students to each of the general law and statutory IP protections outlined above. For each of the heads of protection, the courses gives detailed consideration to the subject matter which is protected, the pre-conditions for protection, and the nature of infringement. Various justifications for IP are also considered, particularly in the context of new or developing forms of IP.
This course, Intellectual Property 2: Trade Marks and Patents, focuses on three aspects of Australian IP law. The first is the legal protection of business reputation, which includes the law of registered trade marks and related doctrines such as the tort of passing off. The requirements for registering marks, infringement and defences, and the elements of passing off will be canvassed, as will policy debates over the scope of legal protection. The second is the law of patents, which protects new innovations. It will cover the acquisition, ownership, exploitation and enforcement of patent rights and look at emerging issues such as the protection of biotechnology. The third is the action for breach of confidence, which protects trade secrets and personal information.

This legislation is voluminous and critical to an understanding of Australian immigration law. This course teaches students how the Act and Regulations operate together to regulate entry and stay in Australia and then focuses upon some regulatory issues in detail.
The workings of the visa system and the different categories of entrants are outlined and general matters relevant to all visa classes (Schedules 3, 4 and 5 of the Migration Regulations) are considered, including health and character criteria. The visa process, family migration and refugee visas are a topic of interest. 
The relationship between immigration and Australian citizenship is considered. 
The relationship between immigration law and Government policy is considered, both in terms of policy considerations underpinning legislative developments and policy considerations operating throughout the administration of the law. The course seeks to critically evaluate immigration law from varied standpoints, including whether it is efficient in achieving policy goals, the extent to which it complies with human rights norms and the rule of law.

LAWS3314,"Term 1 2019, Term 2 2019","Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"Most legal education in common law systems scrutinises the interpretation and development of the law via decisions made by courts in the process of litigation. This fosters the assumption that litigation, or legal advice predicting the outcome of litigation, is the normal method of resolving disputes. In fact only a small proportion of disputes are resolved by litigation and there is a growing dissatisfaction with the cost, speed and adversarial character of litigation, and a corresponding interest in alternative forms of non-adjudicative dispute resolution.
This course follows on from Resolving Civil Disputes, investigating and giving practical experience in a range of alternative forms of dispute resolution including negotiation, facilitation, mediation and group process. It requires students to identify and analyse examples of the interface between the outcomes of non-adjudicative dispute resolution processes and what might be termed 'black-letter law' such as contract and revenue law.
Dispute Resolution is delivered as a skills course. Whilst there will be some formal tuition, the focus of the course is on experiential learning. Skill training depends on a building block approach to learning whereby basic ideas are built upon through group discussion, preparation, performance and review.
Because group dynamics and interaction play such an important part in the process, skills training works most effectively when it occurs in concentrated bursts of a day or more. For this reason, the course is delivered in full day sessions with an introductory lecture at the beginning.

It begins by exploring the question “what is justice”? Since this is an enduring philosophical question, posed differently at different times, it will be approached historically. We examine some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present and how they have understood justice. The focus here will be not only on explaining and critically analysing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law. The course will then put these ideas to work through a consideration of a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, how in modern circumstances might we ground the criteria of justice? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice? Is any interpretation of law always based on an understanding of legal justice? And what are we to make of various claims to justice, for instance, international justice, intergenerational justice, historical or transitional justice?

LAWS3331,"Term 1 2019, Term 2 2019, Term 3 2019","Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"This course encourages students to take a reflective interest in the study of law - its intellectual foundations, its socialconditions, its relationships with morality and politics, and its kinship with other disciplines, especially philosophy, ethicsand social theory. The course is theoretical in the following sense. In their practical, day-to-day, activities, lawyers take,and must take, much for granted: about the nature of the law, about the purposes and functions of its institutions anddoctrines, and about the worth of it all. They practise within established legal systems, with more or less settledinstitutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Customarily they think within the categories and arrangements provided bythe legal system, rather than about them.
Legal Theory is concerned to think about precisely those frameworks that lawyers think within. It aims to probe anddiscuss theoretical questions about law, which underlie the practical stuff of the law. Such questions include matters ofdescription and analysis - what's going on?; of comparison - what else goes on elsewhere and what can it tell us aboutwhat goes on here? - and of evaluation - is what is going on what should be going on? Purported answers to suchquestions are constantly assumed and relied upon in legal talk and action. Legal actors, however - like all social actors -are frequently unaware of the extent to which, or the ways in which, what they take to be perfectly obvious, natural andimpossible to imagine otherwise reflects particular, usually traditional assumptions which are questionable but are rarelyquestioned.
Legal theory examines such assumptions, clarifies the issues with which they are concerned and frequently shows theseissues to be more puzzling and contentious than is commonly assumed. It acquaints students with, and gives themopportunities to think about, question, criticise and defend, some of the most important ingredients in their own thoughtabout the law; ingredients which are all the more important for not being commonly recognised as matters of argument oreven discussion at all.
Theoretical inquiry has no predetermined 'results', or rather just one. Students will decide for themselves whether theyemerge from such inquiry with better or worse reasons to believe what they started with, or whether they should believenew or different things. On the other hand, however they begin, they are unlikely to emerge thinking that the questionsdiscussed in the course have simple, obvious or uncontroversial answers.
In general terms this course discusses the consequences for law of the present ascendancy of two basic ideas – legalpositivism as a dominant approach to understanding law and liberalism as an organising framework for thinking aboutpolitical life. Legalpositivism, basically, is the idea that the validity of law is a matter that can be worked out independentlyof non-legal (e.g. moral) concerns. A liberal understanding of politics among other things takes the conception of ourselvesas self-governing (as autonomous) as its basic value and evaluates legal practices in terms of how well or badly theycontribute to this value. Time is spent discussing these accounts of law and politics.
Along the way we discuss a number of basic ideas associated with contemporary legal/moral/political philosophy. Theseinclude - the nature of legal analysis, the separation of law from other areas of social life, the difference in moral theorybetween the right and the good, moral and personal autonomy, liberalism’s relationship to rights and to cultural andreligious difference, and law’s relationship to justice, democracy and the rule of law.

LAWS3332,"Term 1 2019, Term 2 2019, Term 3 2019","Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"In their practical day-to-day activities, lawyers and citizens take, and must take, much for granted, both about society in which they work and live and about its legal order. Lawyers practice within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Citizens live, and the laws operate, in societies in which specific social arrangements, structures, roles, expectations and conceptions of what is possible and what is right, are widely held and shape our views about law and about society. Customarily, most of us think within these categories and arrangements, rather than about them.
Theoretical investigation of those arrangements and understandings has to do with what underlies them. It is concerned to look beneath what we take for granted, to see what accounts for it, what its nature is, how it works and how it changes. Social theory is concerned to ask such questions about societies in which people live. Investigations about theories of law and society will lead us beyond our original and usually quite unreflectiveviews of what is important in law, what functions itplays,

what it is for, whose interests it serves and how it serves them, what causes legal change and how important law is in society. In probing these questions we might come to confirm, modify or abandon our original assumptions; we will always, however, find these assumptions are more problematic, controversial and puzzling than they appeared at first to be.
 
This course is designed to introduce students to theoretical issues concerning the intricate and complex relationships between law and society. It seeks to do this by acquainting them with several important ways of approaching these issues, and with the sorts of questions best (and worst) addressed by each of these approaches.
 
The course materials are composed of two interlocking parts, each of which seeks to introduce students to a distinct range of questions—and a distinct way of asking such questions—about socio-legal relations.

Part 1—Law and Modernity: Classical Social Theory on Law in Modern Society
 
Classical social theory was born in nineteenth century Europe, that is, at a time and in a place which was undergoing massive and unprecedented social, economic, scientific and intellectual change. The early social theories differed markedly from each other, but they agreed upon one thing: the modern west was developing in ways and at a pace which were unprecedented in European history, and unparalleled anywhere else in this world. This so-called “great transformation” formed the context and topic of classical social theory. It prompted questions which had not been considered as urgently or directly before.
 
Among these are large questions about how people can and should be expected to behave, how increasingly large and complex societies “hang together”; and what differentiates one form of society and legal order from another. Typically the law presupposes that it has the answers to such questions. But in fact these questions have a form and structure that are not amenable to traditional legal analysis: a fact which renders lawyers, who are exercising their own specialised techniques, not especially expert in answering them. Listed immediately below are some of the questions that engaged the attention of the classic founders of modern social theory and which will be covered in the course.

1. What social functions do legal systems in general play, and what functions do specific types of legal systems play?
 
2. Is law necessary (or even beneficial) for orderly social life, or is it better to dispense with it?
 
3. What are the major influences on the nature of the law and legal systems and on change in them—economic, political or internal legal imperatives; the interests of classes or other “ne",Prerequisite: Completion of 78 UOC in LAWS courses.,6 Units of Credit

The precise topics covered will vary in order to match both the knowledge of lecturers and the currency of topics. Examples of what may be covered include:
·         Theories of law and technology and the regulation of technology
·         Understanding the law’s role in channelling, promoting or hindering technological change
·         Regulating disruptive technologies (for example - Uber, Airbnb and 3D printing)
·         Law and changing contexts (for example - offline to online in the context of censorship, speech rights, defamation and reputation management, copyright, privacy)

LAWS3354,Term 2 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"Trade remedies are the most popular area in international trade law practice and the most adjudicated at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). They are actions taken by governments to counteract “dumping” through antidumping measures, subsidies through countervailing measures, and unexpected increases in the volume of imports through safeguard measures, for the protection of domestic industries. A typical form of these measures is an imposition of additional import duties on the top of the standard ones. WTO members are free to resort to trade remedies but must follow the relevant WTO rules.
This course offers a comprehensive and detailed study of the laws and practice of trade remedies. It studies the rationale for trade remedies; the domestic law and practice in selected countries with a focus on Australia (as an active user of trade remedies) and China (as a major target of trade remedies worldwide); the relevant WTO rules and major dispute settlement cases; negotiations of reforms of WTO rules on trade remedies; and the regulation of trade remedies under free trade agreements (FTAs). The course offers abundant opportunities for students to gain legal expertise and practical experience through case studies, simulation, and face-to-face discussion with leading trade and commercial lawyers. As the laws and practice of trade remedies in different jurisdictions share common features and create common issues, this course will provide the knowledge and practical skills necessary for further studies and trade law practice in all major jurisdictions (e.g. Australia, China, the US, the EU, Canada, and India).",Prerequisite: Completion of 78 UOC in LAWS courses.,6 Units of Credit

Each successful applicant for participation in the program is allocated as an intern to a host organisation at the outset of the Term. The host organisation will assign a supervisor for each intern. Students will work under the supervision of a supervisor within the organisation. Students are required to attend their host organisation for 10 days (with up to five additional days at the discretion of the Director of Experiential Learning). In Terms 1 and 2, this will be done on a one day per week basis. In Term 3, students will attend their host organisation for two days per week for the first five weeks of the Term. The range of projects in which the intern is involved will be determined according to the project priorities of the organisation, whilst ensuring educational outcomes are maximised for interns. Generally, it is expected that an intern’s duties will consist of a combination of tasks, including research, project, advocacy, administrative, editing, writing, event coordination, preparing background materials, briefing papers, liaising with other organisations and doing relevant work of a substantive nature.
There are two categories of Host Organisations, for which assessment requirements differ:
Sydney- based Internships : Students may apply to organisations that are based in the Sydney area. These include host organisations at UNSW, and self-organised placementsTravel Internships – Students may apply to host organisations that are based outside Sydney. These include self-organised regional, interstate and overseas hosts.

It builds on and extends students' studies in criminal law, criminal procedure, the law of evidence, legal profession and various clinical and experiental law courses, including Kingsford Legal Centre. It does this by providing a multidisciplinary framework that explicates the role of participants in the criminal trial process. Classroom discussion focuses on commentaries examining a variety of issues associated with the dynamics of criminal trials. These issues vary from year to year, allowing for topical themes to be developed but they include comparative analysis, human rights principles and various multidisciplinary  perspectives including, the observations of historians, psychologists, sociologists, architects and linguists. A practice-orientation is an important component of the course as it assists to develop the rhetoric/reality theme that guides the course. It is fulfilled through guest speakers such as barristers and trial judges and through students fieldwork obligations.  Outside classroom hours students must attend and observe criminal trials in progress. This observation requirement is built into the final assessment, which is an essay based comparing the conduct and practices of participants in observed trials with what the law expects, requires or assumes exists in relation to those participants.
Outside classroom hours students must attend and observe criminal trials in progress. This enables students to not only learn about trial practice first hand but, with classroom discussion and the readings, better appreciate its relationship to doctrinal theory. The observation requirement is also built into the final assessment, which is an essay-based analysis with a choice between two topics. One topic asks students to compare the conduct and practices of participants in observed trials withwhat the law expects, requires or assumes. The other (alternate) topic requires students to explore a miscarriage of justice scenario of their own choice. Finally, a number of guest speakers, such as barristers and trial judges, will contribute to the course.

LAWS8104,Term 3 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"Over the past ten years the concept of children’s rights has received a greater amount of attention in legal discourse.  Internationally, investigations into child labour, child sexual exploitation and child abductions appear to be increasing at an exponential rate.  In many nations of the Western world, reports of prostituted juveniles, young offenders accused of violent crimes and harms related to the new technologies have impacted on communities.  In the South and in many countries in transition, the incidents of child soldiers, child sex tourism and trafficking of young people seem continuously to be highlighted in the media.  Jurisprudence developing from the decisions of domestic courts, administrative tribunals and within international fora has provided insights into policy issues while at the same time offering contradictory messages on the legal responsibility and status of children.  Because of this, there is a need to better understand the current status of the law and what your role may be – as lawyers, advocates or simply as concerned members of civil society – in ensuring that the rights of all citizens are respected, regardless of their age.  It has been said that the phrase ""children’s rights"" is a slogan in search of a definition.  This course will attempt to find its meaning by surveying the history and legal development of children’s rights internationally, while offering a pragmatic approach to its application.

The sharing economy has been defined both narrowly, in terms of the ways in which information technology is used to empower individuals or organisations to distribute, share and re-use excess capacity in goods and services; and more broadly, with an emphasis on shared governance, cooperative work, shared information, crowdsourcing, crowd funding, collective activity, community-building, the commons and cooperative ownership. Whether broad or narrow, the focus is on the ways in which ordinary people are experimenting with different ways of moving around, powering themselves, securing food and making a living, making these transactions less wasteful and potentially more social.

LAWS8189,Term 3 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"This course aims to provide an advanced understanding of how law and regulation relate to current debates about corporate responsibility and the intersection of business with human rights. What would constitute an ideal regulatory and remedial framework on the human rights impacts of business activity? What legal, commercial, political or social forces and factors shape these issues in practice?
Delivered both online and with 2 days of face-to-face teaching, this course analyses the source, nature, content and practical significance of legal, regulatory, self-regulatory and other frameworks governing the ways in which business actors and activities might affect human rights. 
This course addresses complex issues such as attempts to establish a legal basis for arguing corporations must respect human rights; alleged corporate complicity in forced labour in the construction or fishing industries, supply chain regulation in the manufacturing industry; and the obligation of technology companies to respect free speech. With a focus on practical case studies students will be exploring the nexus of two of the most profound social and regulatory phenomena of our time: economic globalisation, and the international human rights narrative.
Through moderated discussions both online and in the classroom and with occasional guest expert input, students navigate some key issues. How can business activity affect the enjoyment of human rights? How effective are existing regulatory responses, and what undermines these? What is the role for business self-regulation, and what is the state's duty to control the social impacts of a business operating abroad? What avenues of remedy exist or should exist? Is a binding international treaty needed? How do companies operate in conflict zones?
The course is of relevance to policymakers, regulators, corporate and financial executives, those in civil society, the media, and the legal profession.",Prerequisite: Academic Program must be either  9200 or 9201 or 9240 or 9211 or 9231 or 9281.,6 Units of Credit

It explores the concept of 'international protection' through the lens of the 1951 Refugee Convention, asking ‘who is a refugee?’, ‘what status does a refugee obtain?’, ‘who is expressly excluded from protection?’, and whether this instrument is still adequate for refugee movements in the 21st century? It examines the notion of complementary protection (how human rights law has expanded States' protection obligations), the role of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the causes of and possible solutions to refugee flows, and the political and ethical issues concerning refugees and other forced migrants, including people trafficking and smuggling. It also examines strategies that countries like Australia have adopted in an attempt to deter asylum seekers, such as detention, interdiction, deflection, and temporary protection, as well as legal constructs devised to shift responsibility to other States, such as the concepts of 'safe third country', 'internal flight alternative', and extraterritorial processing. It undertakes a comparative analysis of practices in the European Union, Canada and the United States, and in regions such as Africa and Latin America.

LAWS8328,Term 1 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"Migration and citizenship are areas that are attracting growing attention by policy-makers and increasing legal regulation globally. In most States the border is the point at which citizens and migrants (non-citizens) are distinguished and legal controls of the movement of migrant populations are focused. Control over the entry, stay and rights of non-citizens is a defining feature of State sovereignty and allows a State to determine the boundaries of the membership of its political community. 
The course adopts a thematic and theoretical approach to examining the legal regulation internationally and by States of the entry and stay of migrants and the status and rights conferred on citizens and non-citizens. It begins with an analysis of the theoretical approaches to global movements of people, including the relationship between the international legal context, State sovereignty, border control and citizenship and individual rights. It then examines the power of the State to refuse entry to, detain and exclude migrants from its territory and to grant, deny or withdraw citizenship status as embodied in the policies and domestic laws of the State and the international legal context in which the movement of people takes place.
The course examines the legal frameworks adopted by States for managing migrant populations and the recognition of citizenship status from a variety of perspectives: theoretical and practical, historical and contemporary, comparative, constitutional, statutory and regulatory. It examines the key theoretical, socio-political, legal and practical questions underlying migration and citizenship law and policy globally.

China opened up its economy to market forces only in the late 1970s. When it did so, law and the legal system lost the pariah status they had been given during the Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The course examines the role law plays in modern China by reference to its historical antecedents. It looks at particular areas of development, not only for their own sake, but also as indicators of the changing role of law in Chinese society. Areas that are the subject of particular attention include: elements and institutions of the Chinese legal system; the role of law in Chinese society from the perspectives of legal history and philosophy; contract law; intellectual property law; foreign investment law; corporate and securities law; foreign trade law; and mediation, arbitration and civil enforcement procedures.

This course examines the legal and policy issues likely to be encountered by an environmental scientist and addresses the question: Is the adversary system the most appropriate method of dealing with conflict in determining the appropriate use of resources? The difficulties encountered with the multiplicity of authorities and interactions between local government regulations, state and federal laws and international law are considered. Case studies examined at each of these levels are used to provide a brief overview of current environmental law in Australia and the World, with examples.
 

The aim of this course is to acquaint students with the fundamental principles of environmental law; and to explain how these principles are applied. The course assumes that participants have little or no background in the law, and so the course also provides some basic instruction about important legal concepts and structures as well as policy approaches to implementation of regulation and enforcement of the law.   

The learning outcomes expected on the completion of this course include:
Demonstrate knowledge of the various sources of environmental law and policyIdentify the influence of common law and international environmental law on the development of Australian lawExplain the structure of environmental laws and engage in critical analysis of the different methods, both regulatory and incentive based, that may be used to implement environmental policyDemonstrate comprehension of the different ways in which environmental disputes may be resolvedNavigate and apply knowledge of environmental planning and assessment processes in the context of natural resourcesDemonstrate awareness of the social and economic context in which environmental law and policy has to be made and recognise the various pressures and influences on the search for optimal environmental protection lawsDemonstrate effective oral communication skills by delivering accurate and insightful contributions in class;Demonstrate effective written communication skills by articulating legal and policy concepts clearly, persuasively and appropriatelyDemonstrate an ability to incorporate a range of legal and interdisciplinary research sources in written communication with appropriate referencing.

The course then addresses customer relationship management, which involves an enterprise-wide customer-centric approach to maximising customer value. It is aimed at creating long-lasting and profitable relationships with individual customers - in both B2B and B2C contexts. Developments in technology have allowed organizations to look at their customers as individuals and to gather, store and analyse customer-based information.

It is natural however that marketing practices will vary from country to country, and culture, economic and social circumstances, and societal infrastructure are different. These differences mean that a successful marketing approach in one country will not automatically work in another country. Customer preferences, competition, distribution channels and communications media differ. Global marketing requires marketers to behave in ways that are global and local at the same time by responding to similarities and differences in various markets. An important task in global marketing is learning to recognize the extent to which marketing plans and programs might be standardised worldwide as well as the extent to which they need to be adapted. The decision to enter markets outside the home country depends on a firm's resources, managerial attitudes, and the nature and extent of opportunities and threats.

MATH2701,Term 3 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"Mathematics went through quite a revolution around the turn of the 20th century. In particular, an axiomatic approach infiltrated the mathematical paradigm, both as a tool to ensure mathematical rigour and to abstract common principles working in a variety of different settings.
First year mathematics emphasizes computation over abstraction and rigour. Later year courses (and Pure Mathematics in general) reverse this, so students need to learn some new skills and some new ways of thinking about mathematical objects.
This course is designed to help you develop the ability to write rigorous mathematical proofs in a setting where the level of abstraction is still quite modest. As such it will serve as an excellent preparation for the third year Pure Mathematics courses.
The course consists of two halves, algebra and analysis, each taught for 6 weeks.
Analysis half. Most of the calculus you have seen involves equalities. Mathematical analysis however, is largely about inequalities, about suitably bounding quantities that cannot be calculated precisely. Many nice examples come from geometry and we will frequently use these to motiva????te our discussion in the first part of the analysis section. In the latter part we will look more closely at some aspects of the real numbers, such as how well one can approximate π by a rational p/?? (in terms of how large ?? is).
Algebra half. We will investigate various transformations on the plane and projective plane. We will first study several types of transformations such as translations, reflections, rotations etc. in terms of groups. We will then look at symmetries, i.e. transformations of geometric figures that preserve some property (such as distance or angles between lines), and projective geometry. Projective transformations can change a conic section of one type to another, e.g. an ellipse to a hyperbola.","Prerequisite: MATH1231 or MATH1241 or MATH1251 with at least a CR, enrolment in an advanced maths or advanced science program",6 Units of Credit

MATH3121,Term 1 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"This course builds on MATH2120 Mathematical Methods for Differential Equations in that it is concerned with ways of solving the (usually partial) differential equations that arise mainly in physical, biological and engineering applications.
Analytical methods have considerable intrinsic interest, but their importance for applications is the driving motive behind this course. The main analytical tools developed in this course can be thought of as generalisations of the Fourier and power series representations of functions studied in MATH2120. This leads to new types of functions and to practical methods for solving differential equations. We will pay special attention to functions defined on infinite domains.
The course begins by characterising different partial differential equations (PDEs), and exploring similarity solutions and the method of characteristics to solve them. The Fourier transform, the natural extension of a Fourier series expansion is then investigated. For functions of time, the Fourier transform corresponds to the “spectrum” of the function or signal in the problem in the frequency domain. Closely related to the Fourier transform is the Laplace transform which is particularly useful for solving the initial value PDEs that arise in many physical applications. Although contour integration is an intrinsic part of using these transforms, only brief references to complex variable methods will be made.
Transforms give a wide insight into the behaviour of a function and suggests other possibilities for the integral representation of solutions of PDEs. By exploiting certain special solutions of a given linear PDE we eventually obtain the idea of a Green's function for the PDE and a corresponding integral form for the solution. The power of Green's functions can be observed in their use as the inverses of differential operators on both infinite and bounded domains.
Frequently it is not possible to evaluate in closed form the Fourier, Laplace or Green’s function integrals appearing in the solution of the given PDE. All is not lost as we can still explore the asymptotic behaviour of these integrals at large parameter values and obtain physically useful information on the solution of the underlying problem.","Prerequisite: 12 units of credit in Level 2 Math courses including (MATH2011 or MATH2111) and (MATH2120 or MATH2130 or MATH2121 or MATH2221), or (both MATH2019 (DN) and MATH2089), or (both MATH2069 (DN) and MATH2099)",6 Units of Credit
