Negotiated work-based learning agreements involving the university, workplace organisation and student, focusing on agreed workplace activities and production of a workplace relevant product/report
Full-time immersion in the workplace to support practitioner development and understanding of organisational context, realities and operational rhythms and challenges
During the placement, students will have two supervisors (one academic, one workplace based) and will be required to undertake 160 hours in the workplace (approximately 20 hours/week over 8 weeks. The way the course is structured provides time for Schon's reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action,  both essential elements for the integration of knowledge, skills and experience.

The course includes an introduction to ethics and explores the ethical challenges of balancing the interests of individuals and society within a healthcare context. Differences between the strong community focus of public health ethics and the more individual focus of clinical ethics are also studied. An introductory briefing on health law is provided together with discussions on common issues of concern relating to public health and health management law. Students are given opportunities to apply their learning to particular issues of interest in public health and health care management.
The course is offered in external mode and involves weekly online tutorials as well as a compulsory one day Foundations Workshop at the start of the course.
The course aims to deliver knowledge and skills in identifying ethical and legal issues in health care policy development by reference to some recurring tensions:  Balancing individual rights with the goal of achieving healthy populations; the challenges of health care rationing; and addressing the needs of particular groups.  We will bring these issues to life through a series of case studies, including tobacco control policy, the 'obesity epidemic'?, pandemic influenza, involuntary treatment for mental illness, vaccination policy and cancer screening. These case studies form the basis of online discussions and provide a practical anchor for developing students' understanding of the relevant ethical and legal issues.
Perhaps more than any other discipline, discussion and collaboration is the key to ethical decision making.  Communication with stakeholder groups and drawing on expertise across a range of disciplines including economics, law, sociology, the various health care professions, research fields including epidemiology, infection control and so on, are central to creating policy and designing appropriate and effective laws.  Online group discussions are central to students learning in this course as students will learn from each other, drawing on the diverse experiences and interestrests in the student group, as well as from the course materials.

You may be one of those people who asks yourself ""what economics has to do with health and health care?"" For some people, economics seems quite at odds with fundamental social goals such as  'good health'. The answer lies in the fact that resources are inevitably scarce and choices have to be made about their allocation. Health economics is about the optimisation of health relative to other activities and making choices to use resources in ways that improve health and service delivery within the limited resources available. Health economics can provide insight into questions like:  Which is the more effective method of increasing the uptake of health services: price-controls or subsidies? How will the involvement of the private sector in the funding and delivery of health care affect access to it? What are the most cost-effective mechanisms for delivering essential medicines to those living in remote areas? Are out of pocket payments for health care a regressive funding mechanism? How should doctors be paid? The primary goal of this course is to provide participants with the knowledge, skills, and basic economic arguments that are central to discussions about health policy options and resource allocation choices in low and middle income countries. By the end of the course, students will be in a stronger position to (i) Demonstrate understanding of the main functions and challenges facing health systems in the developing world; (ii) explain the key economic principles and concepts relevant to health economics and financing; (iii) discuss specific features that distinguish markets for health care from markets for other goods and services; (iv) distinguish between the principal ways of funding health services and paying health care providers; and (v) critically appraise evidence on the efficiency and equity implications of health financing reforms in low and middle income countries.",Prerequisite: Students who are not enrolled in a postgraduate program in the School of Public Health and Community Medicine will need to provide approval from their program authority and the approval of the course convenor to postgrad-sphcm@unsw.edu.au,6 Units of Credit

Students consider questions of spatial disadvantage, social exclusion, ‘spatial justice’ and equity, and ‘rights to the city’. Change in the built environment invariably impacts on disadvantaged and disenfranchised groups disproportionately, where for example redevelopment and gentrification may be accompanied by quickly changing community profiles, rising housing costs, unhealthy environments and potential displacement. As planners we must steward the future direction of our cities and communities in ways which value and foster diversity. Planners must ensure that the interests and needs of all groups, including ethnic communities, children, the aged, women, people with disabilities, people of all sexual preferences, Indigenous and homeless people are heard. Planners are also increasingly engaged with the creation of healthy built environments, fostering wellbeing alongside health professionals in decisions taken which affect the built environment's ability to be supportive of healthy behaviour. The role and capacity of current planning frameworks to achieve more equitable and health supportive outcomes are explored, including the preparation of community strategic plans, the use of social and health impact assessments, as well as more creative inter-disciplinary and bottom-up consultative approaches and working practices.",Pre-requisite: PLAN1003,6 Units of Credit

It is thematically structured around key concepts such as ‘contemporaneity’, ‘archive’, ‘fiction’, ‘decoloniality’ and ‘global art’. Such concepts are a means to navigate and articulate some of the most significant concerns of contemporary art. But they are also essential for articulating contemporary art’s entanglement with a broad range of interconnected political, social, economic and ecological phenomena. Art’s complex and interdisciplinary relationship to the present will be examined through series of case studies and art historical/theoretical texts. The course, and the resources it engages, will further develop postgraduate students' critical analytical capacities and independent research skills, while advancing their vocabulary of key concepts central to contemporary art discourse.",No Prerequisites,6 Units of Credit

SAHT9201,Term 1 2019,"Art & Design, Paddington",0,1,"The collection, preservation and conservation of objects and artworks is a central role of the cultural sector. The way we understand objects and their relations to collections are changing. Likewise, new art practices and non-object based projects provide challenges to organisations whose mission is to display and preserve contemporary culture.
Professionals working with diverse collections need to be able to identify and comply with various and sometimes competing frameworks of significance and value when working with material culture. As well as examining the recording of collections and exhibitions, you will consider issues relevant to material preservation and conservation addressing debates of cultural sensitivity and significance in order to understand how collection policies determine what gets preserved in contemporary institutions. An understanding of these issues and adoption of these skills will ensure best practice when handling objects in both exhibition and collection management settings. This course will help you develop knowledge of the professional procedures required of galleries, museums and custodians of cultural heritage.

SAHT9311,Term 3 2019,"Art & Design, Paddington",0,1,"Contemporary curatorial practice is increasingly preoccupied with notions of public engagement and participation, in the context of debates over Relational Aesthetics, socially engaged arts practice and the relationship of art and activism.  Curatorial Studio: Curating in Social Space enables students to operate creatively, critically and effectively within this context as both initiators and collaborators. 
This studio aims to equip students with a critical understanding of some of the key theoretical and practical issues confronting curators working in “social space”. The studio is aimed at those wishing to extend the curatorial field beyond existing audiences of the “white cube” to reach variegated, specific and diverse publics both within and without gallery spaces. Through this studio students will critically evaluate notions of “community”, “participation”, “collaboration” and “public” to develop their own ideas on how to construct an encounter between “audience”, “social praxis” and “art”. 
This course will provide real life situations, supported by partnerships with experienced individuals and institutions, where students can develop their own independent approaches to curating in social situations.  By the end of the course students will have chosen a specific community within which to work, developed a curatorial premise, produced a project text, and curated a project. Students will develop skills in determining who is their intended audience, attempting to reach that audience, and evaluating how successfully their project has operated within the defined social space.
This studio will equally weight participatory, collaborative, curatorial and textual components encouraging students to engage with the complexity of how curatorial knowledge is produced and activated. This studio will encourage self-reflexivity by integrating forms of self-assessment within external assessment procedures.",No Prerequisites,6 Units of Credit
