AVIA5001,Term 1 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"This course aims to provide students with an overview of the regulatory structure of civil aviation in
Australia. Aviation and the law share some basic similarities. Both the aviation and legal professions
are highly specialised and each require an extensive degree of training before one can be classed as
a “professional” within the respective disciplines. Although aviation professionals are highly trained
technicians or managers it does not follow that such training has necessarily included training in the
law and legal systems.

The fact that the aviation industry is a highly regulated and legislated sector provides an even greater
reason why today’s aviation professional should be conversant with, and knowledgeable of, the law
as it applies to the aviation industry. In most sections of the aviation industry there are no formal
requirements for training in the law or legal systems. Of course there is a myriad of rules and
regulations in aviation that must be known but that does not equate to training in statutory
interpretation or the like.

Aviation professionals, like their legal counterparts, spend a long time undertaking formal, structured
training. Then there follows years of practical, on-the-job training. In fact the training never really
ends. Both professions require ongoing professional training. Because of the extensive time taken to
“learn the profession” quite often people working in the aviation sector enter at an early age. It is not

AVIA5005,Term 1 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"This course is complementary to AVIA5009 Airline Corporate Management which is also provided in the MScTech (Aviation)/MAvMgmt program. The introductory module of this course provides a brief overview of the corporate side of airline management and its relationship with the following modules.
Airline operations are defined as the functional areas which are directly associated with the operations of the aircraft and in the provision of operational support services. There is much overlap between the management of “corporate” and “operational” aspects of an airline. This occurs mainly in the planning processes such as fleet planning, schedule planning, and strategic planning (including business plans
and annual budgets). These important processes will be covered in this course for the functional areas that play major roles in the airline.

Engineering and maintenance, airline airport operations, crew resource provision and inflight service functions are specifically covered in some detail. As well as those important functional areas, other airline processes are covered which play important roles in the operations. These include emergency planning, operations control, and punctuality management.

The more recent interest in outsourcing in airline management is looked at as airlines pursue the reduction in costs and head towards the “virtual” airline. There is a module on environmental matters in the airline and also a chapter on freight. Perhaps the latter is a little misplaced but those of you who do both the courses on Airline management should have some exposure to the freight part of the airline.
General management techniques apply to many of these functional areas. Planning, budgeting, staff and equipment rostering, and disruption management are generic but in this course are discussed from the airline’s view. The management of aircraft, crew (both technical and cabin service crew), and inflight service functions are complex, especially the impact each has on the other.

AVIA5015,Term 1 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"This course is intended to provide the student with an understanding of the principles that apply to an aviation safety system and an understanding the complex interaction between individuals and organisations to which those principles apply.

Modern jet transport systems now enable people to travel vast distances at high-speed, within a highly hazardous environment, yet paradoxically with minimal risk. A significant reason for this is the development of Safety Management Systems (SMS). Successful completion of this module is expected to equip the student with the theoretical knowledge of the requirements of a SMS as described by the
International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the Civil Aviation Authority (Australia) (CASA).
Another aspect of a modern SMS is the investigation of aircraft accidents and incidents. In the past, engineering solutions led to significant improvements. However, over time, such investigations revealed that accidents and incidents were often not the product of a single cause, but were more likely to have resulted from a combination of factors. Many of those factors were linked to the ways in which the behaviour of individuals was adversely influenced by task related and systemic conditions, which has led to a breakdown in safety. With the growing complexity of aviation passenger transport operations it has therefore become increasingly necessary to look beyond the actions of individuals in order to understand those system based, error-producing conditions that adversely influence their actions.
Safety management systems are now increasingly used by organisations to ensure that all aspects of their operations that could affect safety have been adequately addressed. Typically, such systems provide for:
• The establishment of organisational safety objectives and policy;
• A commitment by senior management to safety;
• The promotion of a positive safety culture;
• The identification of safety hazards and the management of risk;
• The means of measuring and maintaining organisational safety health:
• Procedures for the rectification of safety deficiencies; and
• Emergency response procedures.",No Prerequisites,6 Units of Credit

AVIA5022,Term 2 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"This 6 UoC course is intended to provide you with a general understanding of the processes of aircraft incident and accident investigation, in order that you might better understand the role of air safety investigation in the wider aviation context. The investigation of aircraft incidents and accidents is now recognized as an essential component of an effective safety management system. By its very nature, an aircraft accident represents some form of failure of the aviation safety system. In many cases, valuable insights into the safety health of an organization can be gained by the effective use of proven incident / accident investigation techniques. Such investigations are necessarily ‘reactive’ but do provide a valuable ‘snapshot’ of how flight operations, maintenance practices and general company management was actually being conducted at the time of the event. When combined with a ‘proactive’ incident reporting and investigation program (now components of a Safety Management System) the often hidden factors that adversely influence the actions of operational personnel can be revealed.
The investigation techniques examined in this course are directed solely to the objective of accident prevention. The apportioning of blame or the determination of liability is not part of this process. In many cases, aircraft accident investigations are commenced in chaotic, stressful, and sometimes physically challenging situations.

The provision of airport infrastructure is costly and there usually is a limited number of sites in a given area suitable for airport development. Proposals to build new airports or to undertake major redevelopments at existing airports attract considerable public attention. A modern airport also is a complex economic and legal entity in which a variety of stakeholders are required to cooperate to deliver what is in principle a very simple product – the transfer of passengers and cargo between air and ground transport. It is not surprising to find that there are many courses on airport management and a wealth of published material on almost every aspect of airport development and operations.

BEES6800,"Term 1 2019, Term 3 2019","Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"The Science of Science Communication course aims to teach science students how to effectively communicate across a range of audiences why science matters, how it works, and what the relevance of science is to the way we live our lives. Students will learn to do that effectively in a digital age where the content is easily accessed but the understanding of that information is harder to achieve. They will also learn how to measure the effectiveness of their communication of science. Understanding the art of evidence based science communication has become more important than ever before in a world where fake science news threatens our ability to communicate science effectively. 
For those students going on to a higher degree in science, a basic requirement of being a successful scientist is to be able to effectively communicate. However, very few scientists have had any formal evidence-based science communication education. Fewer still have been taught how new emerging communication technologies can engage audiences with science or how to use emotion and be personable when communicating science. This course prepares students for a career in their chosen science discipline.
The objective of BEES6800 is to help students to gain confidence in clearly communicating science and why it matters across multiple peer and public audiences in multiple modes, and via multiple digital technologies and media – including social media. 
The course is mostly online. 
There are two face-to-face weeks for which there will be an online equivalent of at least lecture recordings for students unable to attend in person. One of these two weeks will be an experience in the Mars Lab education and research facility at the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, and in which UNSW is a partner. The second will be a week of activities, including discussion and debate, on the issues of fake science news and miscommunication of science news.
Assessment will be through three connected online assignments that directly address course outcomes.These outcomes include understanding the nature and processes of science, being able to communicate science clearly with multiple audiences in multiple modes, understanding the best use of new and emerging technologies to communicate science, thinking critically and creatively, and knowing how to measure the effectiveness of science communication.

predominately within NSW and metropolitan Sydney, the course will, however, explore heritage planning in Australia
at World, National, State and Local levels.
By undertaking Heritage Planning you will develop your appreciation and understanding of the physical and nonphysical
aspects of Australia’s heritage. The course will provide you with an introduction to the various statues that
apply to heritage within Australia and NSW. During the first half of the semester, we will cover the history of heritage
conservation in Australia, including the ICOMOS Burra Charter, and how heritage is identified, assessed and
managed at World, National, Commonwealth, and State and Local levels. Following mid-semester break, our focus
shifts and we concentrate on different aspects of our heritage including; cultural landscapes, Aboriginal and settler
archaeology, built heritage, cultural landscapes, interpretation and intangible values. Throughout the course you will
learn from experienced professionals working in the public and private sectors. They will present various disciplinary
perspectives including archaeology, architecture and landscape architecture. The guest lecturers will talk about their
‘real life’ experience of working in heritage in the context of the legislation and urban development in Sydney and
elsewhere.
Drawing on this professional experience, the course will canvass some of the different approaches to understanding
heritage and conservation. Many of these approaches are political and official, involving governments at international,
national, state and local levels. They are also formal and involve statutory planning processes such as identification,
assessment, listing via planning instruments and heritage registers, and provisions for permits and applications. In
each case, the approaches, solutions and outcomes for heritage projects vary based on political will, economic
issues, the formal protective mechanisms, professional judgments, subjectivity and community values.
The primary aim of the course is to ensure that as future professionals in the fields of urban planning, architecture and
landscape architecture, you develop a sound understanding of the theoretical, legislative, administrative and practical
aspects of heritage conservation that is grounded in ‘real world experience’. This, in turn, will enable you to gain an
understanding of how heritage and the values attributed to it change through time and reflect how we see ourselves

BENV7813,Term 2 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"This elective will focus on one of architectures primary modes of investigation; the model. As a critical part of the design process the model expresses ideas and concepts in three dimensions with concern for materials, lighting, space and, nowadays, interactivity; in other words the model literally presents all of the components of a finished architecture. Traditionally architectural models have been hand-made which both reflected the building process of the time and a cultural longing by architects to be more directly involved in the production of their work (many architects design products, especially furniture, for the same reason). But for some time now architecture has been tending towards the assembly of factory made components; and, as can be seen across the world, factories tend towards automated machine-made production. It’s worthwhile to point out at this stage that beautiful things are created in factories. Porsche, Honda, Apple, Prada and Boeing (to name a few) all use factories to create amazingly sophisticated products; most for a fraction of the cost of the average architect designed building.   
If architectural models should reflect both the finished architecture and its mode of production they will need to employ automated processes such as digital modelling, laser cutting, CNC milling and rapid prototyping. However, this elective isn’t dogmatic; several hand-made processes will also be employed (hot-wire cutting blue foam, casting, sheet metal folding). In this elective students will be trained to use and have direct access to all of these machines.

Unfortunately, only a small proportion of people ever gain more than a superficial understanding of natural selection and how evolution works.
