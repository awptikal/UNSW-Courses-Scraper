There is no doubt about the positive benefits of engaging in sports. The power of sports, however, goes well beyond the playing field, and individual benefit.  Sports traditionally are not appreciated for the vast extent of social good, and positive change  they can bring, in  both developing and developed countries.
This course will introduce students to the exciting new and emerging field of sport for development and social change (S4D/SC), where the power of sport goes well beyond the traditional playing fields to address health and social challenges. Through an inspiring mix of workshops, case studies, multi-media, field visits to see SD in action and guest experts, students will engage with the compelling power of this emerging field of sport for development and social change.

Popular (incorrect) answers include energy, heat, faeces and sweat. Surprisingly, this question has also baffled health professionals including general practitioners, dietitians and professional trainers. 
This course will lift the veil on weight loss by tracing every atom you eat into and out of your body, and you will learn the fate of fat during weight loss, that is, it is converted to carbon dioxide and water and exits your body mainly through your lungs. Along the way, you will also learn how humans convert foods into useful energy, what exactly is happening in your bodies during weight loss and weight gain, and by the end you will be able to critically examine popular weight loss claims as well as your own diet and lifestyle.

Woven through the course is a critical examination of the interaction between the criminal justice system and the criminal law: specifically, that application of the law is shaped by and dependent on decisions made by criminal justice actors including police, prosecutors and judicial officers. Specific areas of focus include: why some activities are criminalised and others not; the use and misuse of discretion; the impact of the reliance on summary justice; the significance of pre-trial processes such as search, arrest and bail; and the over-representation of Indigenous people and other vulnerable groups.  Crime and the Criminal Process also introduces the doctrinal building blocks of criminal law, and applies these principles to a number of key statutory offences such as public order offences and drugs offences which illustrate the process themes above. The impact of public policy and law reform is an important underlying theme.

It examines the structures, rules and values that enable ethical practice for lawyers. The course explores ethical issues that arise in professional practice and the regulations and standards that govern them. It considers these issues and principles in light of our personal values, experiences and psychological biases, as well as wider and dynamic professional contexts. These contexts include the history and workings of the legal profession and its rapidly changing circumstances. They also include the diverse and demanding environments in which contemporary lawyers work.
This course treats questions of ethics as found in everyday decisions and behaviour, general as well as those particular to lawyers. However, Lawyers, Ethics & Justiceaddresses, in particular, the responsibilities of lawyers in maintaining the integrity of the justice system. In doing so, students will analyse the roles lawyers do and should play in the justice system, and relate them to the values and routine skills lawyers have, or should have, to ensure effective and just outcomes.
The course is also designed for students to evaluate the conduct of lawyers, the nature of ethical practice, and the pursuit of justice in light of their own identities, values and skills. Students are asked to consider what acting in accordance their values would mean for their own professional lives.
During the course, students will start to develop the skills they will need to engage in ethical legal practice, including those to: identify and address ethics issues; work with colleagues and other professionals to institute and maintain ethical work practices; recognise and manage the diverse needs and interests of clients; and integrate often competing duties to clients, the workplace, the profession, the judicial system and society.

The course exposes students to this material through an examination of Australia’s hybrid constitutional inheritance from the United Kingdom and United States, as adapted in the creation and subsequent development of the federal Commonwealth. In doing so it also examines the implications of colonisation for Indigenous legal systems and assertions of Crown sovereignty. The role, powers and interrelationship of the three arms of government are considered in contemporary as well as historical context, as are the issues of rights protection and constitutional change.

With respect to contract law, this course covers the formation of contracts and the doctrine of privity. Several other elements of contract law are dealt with later in the curriculum in Contracts. With respect to property law, this course considers the boundaries of the concept of property, as well as several of the rules with respect to the creation, transfer and protection of property rights.

The course also introduces students to two smaller topics: agency and equitable estoppel. As well as being closely related to contracts and property, these are two important areas of law for practicing lawyers.

Common law reasoning and the elements of legal problem solving are introduced via a case study based on intentional torts, and the interpretation and application of statutes are developed throughout the course. The course emphasises the historical origins and dynamic nature of the Australian legal system as a settler colonial system, developing in the context of a changing Australian society. Through a consideration of the relationships between the principal institutions of government under Australian Constitutions – parliaments, the executive and the courts – it introduces students to key values and constructs underpinning the Australian legal system, including the significance, and limits, of conceptions of the ‘rule of law’. The course explores the nature of the common law and common law reasoning, with a particular emphasis on the circumstances of the adoption of the common law in the Australian states, the common law’s role in facilitating dispossession, and the ongoing impact of colonisation for Indigenous people in Australia. It also explores the processes by which cases are decided by judges, introducing some theoretical frameworks that have been used to analyse law and legal decision making. The roles of judges, practising lawyers and other personnel in the court system are also considered, with an emphasis on the need for the development of professional identities and resilience, as well as the role of lawyers in promoting just outcomes. Legal research methods and legal citation are taught via the Legal Research and Writing (Stage 1) tutorials attached to JURD7152.

Lawyers practice within established legal systems, with more or lesssettled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Citizens live, and the laws operate, in societies in which specificsocial arrangements, structures, roles, expectations and conceptions of what is possible and what is right, are widely heldand shape our views about law and about society. Customarily, most of us think within these categories andarrangements, rather than about them.
Theoretical investigation of those arrangements and understandings has to do with what underlies them. It isconcerned to look beneath what we take for granted, to see what accounts for it, what its nature is, how itworks and how it changes. Social theory is concerned to ask such questions about societies in which peoplelive. Investigations about theories of law and society will lead us beyond our original and usually quiteunreflectiveviews of what is important in law, what functions itplays, what it is for, whose interests it serves and how it serves them, what causes legal change and how important law is in society. In probing these questions we might come to confirm, modify or abandon our original assumptions; we will always, however, find these assumptions are more problematic, controversial and puzzling than they appeared at first to be.

This course is designed to introduce students to theoretical issues concerning the intricate and complex relationships between law and society. It seeks to do this by acquainting them with several important ways of approaching these issues, and with the sorts of questions best (and worst) addressed by each of these approaches.
 
The course materials are composed of two interlocking parts, each of which seeks to introduce students to a distinct range of questions—and a distinct way of asking such questions—about socio-legal relations.

Part 1—Law and Modernity: Classical Social Theory on Law in Modern Society
 
Classical social theory was born in nineteenth century Europe, that is, at a time and in a place which was undergoing massive and unprecedented social, economic, scientific and intellectual change. The early social theories differed markedly from each other, but they agreed upon one thing: the modern west was developing in ways and at a pace which were unprecedented in European history, and unparalleled anywhere else in this world. This so-called “great transformation” formed the context and topic of classical social theory. It prompted questions which had not been considered as urgently or directly before.
 
Among these are large questions about how people can and should be expected to behave, how increasingly large and complex societies “hang together”; and what differentiates one form of society and legal order from another. Typically the law presupposes that it has the answers to such questions. But in fact these questions have a form and structure that are not amenable to traditional legal analysis: a fact which renders lawyers, who are exercising their own specialised techniques, not especially expert in answering them. Listed immediately below are some of the questions that engaged the attention of the classic founders of modern social theory and which will be covered in the course.

1. What social functions do legal systems in general play, and what functions do specific types of legal systems play?
 
2. Is law necessary (or even beneficial) for orderly social life, or is it better to dispense with it?
 
3. What are the major influences on the nature of the law and legal systems and on change in them—economic, political or internal legal imperatives; the interests of classes or other “new social moveme",Pre-requisite: 24 UOC completed in LLB courses or 24 UOC completed in Juris Doctor courses.

JURD7223,"Term 1 2019, Term 2 2019, Term 3 2019","Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"This course encourages students to take a reflective interest in the study of law - its intellectual foundations, its socialconditions, its relationships with morality and politics, and its kinship with other disciplines, especially philosophy, ethicsand social theory. The course is theoretical in the following sense. In their practical, day-to-day, activities, lawyers take,and must take, much for granted: about the nature of the law, about the purposes and functions of its institutions anddoctrines, and about the worth of it all. They practise within established legal systems, with more or less settledinstitutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Customarily they think within the categories and arrangements provided bythe legal system, rather than about them.
Legal Theory is concerned to think about precisely those frameworks that lawyers think within. It aims to probe anddiscuss theoretical questions about law, which underlie the practical stuff of the law. Such questions include matters ofdescription and analysis - what's going on?; of comparison - what else goes on elsewhere and what can it tell us aboutwhat goes on here? - and of evaluation - is what is going on what should be going on? Purported answers to suchquestions are constantly assumed and relied upon in legal talk and action. Legal actors, however - like all social actors -are frequently unaware of the extent to which, or the ways in which, what they take to be perfectly obvious, natural andimpossible to imagine otherwise reflects particular, usually traditional assumptions which are questionable but are rarelyquestioned.
Legal theory examines such assumptions, clarifies the issues with which they are concerned and frequently shows theseissues to be more puzzling and contentious than is commonly assumed. It acquaints students with, and gives themopportunities to think about, question, criticise and defend, some of the most important ingredients in their own thoughtabout the law; ingredients which are all the more important for not being commonly recognised as matters of argument oreven discussion at all.
Theoretical inquiry has no predetermined 'results', or rather just one. Students will decide for themselves whether theyemerge from such inquiry with better or worse reasons to believe what they started with, or whether they should believenew or different things. On the other hand, however they begin, they are unlikely to emerge thinking that the questionsdiscussed in the course have simple, obvious or uncontroversial answers.
In general terms this course discusses the consequences for law of the present ascendancy of two basic ideas – legalpositivism as a dominant approach to understanding law and liberalism as an organising framework for thinking aboutpolitical life. Legalpositivism, basically, is the idea that the validity of law is a matter that can be worked out independentlyof non-legal (e.g. moral) concerns. A liberal understanding of politics among other things takes the conception of ourselvesas self-governing (as autonomous) as its basic value and evaluates legal practices in terms of how well or badly theycontribute to this value. Time is spent discussing these accounts of law and politics.
Along the way we discuss a number of basic ideas associated with contemporary legal/moral/political philosophy. Theseinclude - the nature of legal analysis, the separation of law from other areas of social life, the difference in moral theorybetween the right and the good, moral and personal autonomy, liberalism’s relationship to rights and to cultural andreligious difference, and law’s relationship to justice, democracy and the rule of law.
In order to make these ideas more concrete we relate them to certain ‘problems’ of contemporary legal practice.

The point of departure will be a consideration of the character of justice. Since this is an enduring philosophical question, posed differently at different times, it will be approached historically. We examine what some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present-day have understood about the nature of justice. The focus will be not only on explaining and critically analyzing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law.
Not only will the course analyse different theories of justice, but it will also put the ideas, gained through such analysis, to work by considering a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, what are the criteria of justice and how in modern circumstances might we ground these? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice? Is any interpretation of law always based on an understanding of legal justice? And what are we to make of various claims to justice, for instance, international justice, intergenerational justice, historical or transitional justice?

It covers topics of concern toindividuals as well as business and government, including protection of intellectual property in a digital environment,electronic contracts, computer and information security, and cyber crime.
The interaction between traditional law and modern technology plays a central role in the course. In order to analyse theimpact and application of traditional legal principles in a new technological environment, the principles must be translatedinto the language of the technologies involved. The translation must preserve the original meaning and policy rationale. Itis the aim of the course to teach, encourage and nurture such thinking. Examples of problems we shall encounter andanalyze in the course include the connection between enabling technologies of cyber crime and the contours of liability ofcyber criminals and their enablers; how an understanding of the Internet informs whether notice of electronic contractualterms is properly provided by a hyperlink; and determining whether an implied term of fitness for purpose can be read intoa contract to download software.
A statement by Professor Lawrence Lessig captures the essence of the course: “[w]hen dealing with cyberspace, judgesare to be translators; different technologies are the different languages; and the aim is to find a reading of [legal principles]that preserves [their] meaning from one world’s technology to another. This is fidelity as translation.”[1] Lawyers who failto understand the translation will likely pursue sub-optimal litigation strategies, face speculative recovery prospects, andmay overlook effective and potentially powerful defences.

The point of departure will be a consideration of the character of justice. Since this is an enduring philosophical question, posed differently at different times, it will be approached historically. We examine what some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present-day have understood about the nature of justice. The focus will be not only on explaining and critically analyzing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law.
Not only will the course analyse different theories of justice, but it will also put the ideas, gained through such analysis, to work by considering a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, what are the criteria of justice and how in modern circumstances might we ground these? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice? Is any interpretation of law always based on an understanding of legal justice? And what are we to make of various claims to justice, for instance, international justice, intergenerational justice, historical or transitional justice?

The first part of the course focuses on the 1951 Refugee Convention, including who qualifies for refugee status, the protections afforded to refugees and the procedures for refugee status determination. The second part of the course considers the capacity of the current international legal framework to respond to displaced persons who do not fall within the Refugee Convention, such as internallydisplaced persons, persons fleeing human rights abuses or civil war, and those whose movement is a result of climate change or environmental catastrophe. The course considers the theoretical underpinnings of the international forced migration regime and queries why States have agreed to protect certain categories of persons and not others, and whether this is legally and/or ethically sound.
This course considers the legal obligations of States and international organisations to assist and protect forced migrants. While the focus of the course is on international law responses to issues of forced migration, consideration will also be given to the relationship between the international legal regime and domestic law. In particular, this course will provide an opportunity to discuss current issues in forced migration regulation in Australia.

Internationally, investigations into child labour, child sexual exploitation and child abductions appear to be increasing at an exponential rate. In many nations of the Western world, reports of prostituted juveniles, young offenders accused of violent crimes and harms related to the new technologies have impacted on communities. In the South and in many countries in transition, the incidents of child soldiers, child sex tourism and trafficking of young people seem continuously to be highlighted in the media. Jurisprudence developing from the decisions of domestic courts, administrative tribunals and withininternational fora has provided insights into policy issues while at the same time offering contradictory messages on the legal responsibility and status of children. Because of this, there is a need to better understand the current status of the law and what your role may be – as lawyers, advocates or simply as concerned members of civil society – in ensuring that the rights of all citizens are respected, regardless of their age. It has been said that the phrase ""children’s rights"" is a slogan in search of a definition.

JURD7431,"Term 1 2019, Term 2 2019, Term 3 2019","Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"This course encourages students to take a reflective interest in the study of law - its intellectual foundations, its social conditions, its relationships with morality and politics, and its kinship with other disciplines, especially philosophy, ethics and social theory. The course is theoretical in the following sense.  In their practical, day-to-day, activities, lawyers take, and must take, much for granted: about the nature of the law, about the purposes and functions of its institutions and doctrines, and about the worth of it all.  They practise within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules.  Customarily they think within the categories and arrangements provided by the legal system, rather than about them. 
 
Legal Theory is concerned to think about precisely those frameworks that lawyers think within.  It aims to probe and discuss theoretical questions about law, which underlie the practical stuff of the law.  Such questions include matters of description and analysis - what's going on?; of comparison - what else goes on elsewhere and what can it tell us about what goes on here? - and of evaluation - is what is going on what should be going on? Purported answers to such questions are constantly assumed and relied upon in legal talk and action. Legal actors, however - like all social actors - are frequently unaware of the extent to which, or the ways in which, what they take to be perfectly obvious, natural and impossible to imagine otherwise reflects particular, usually traditional assumptions which are questionable but are rarely questioned.

Legal theory examines such assumptions, clarifies the issues with which they are concerned and frequently shows these issues to be more puzzling and contentious than is commonly assumed.  It acquaints students with, and gives them opportunities to think about, question, criticise and defend, some of the most important ingredients in their own thought about the law; ingredients which are all the more important for not being commonly recognised as matters of argument or even discussion at all. 
 
Theoretical inquiry has no predetermined 'results', or rather just one. Students will decide for themselves whether they emerge from such inquiry with better or worse reasons to believe what they started with, or whether they should believe new or different things. On the other hand, however they begin, they are unlikely to emerge thinking that the questions discussed in the course have simple, obvious or uncontroversial answers.

In general terms this course discusses the consequences for law of the present ascendancy of two basic ideas – legal positivism as a dominant approach to understanding law and liberalism as an organising framework for thinking about political life. Legalpositivism, basically, is the idea that the validity of law is a matter that can be worked out independently of non-legal (e.g. moral) concerns. A liberal understanding of politics among other things takes the conception of ourselves as self-governing (as autonomous) as its basic value and evaluates legal practices in terms of how well or badly they contribute to this value. Time is spent discussing these accounts of law and politics.
 
Along the way we discuss a number of basic ideas associated with contemporary legal/moral/political philosophy. These include - the nature of legal analysis, the separation of law from other areas of social life, the difference in moral theory between the right and the good, moral and personal autonomy, liberalism’s relationship to rights and to cultural and religious difference, and law’s relationship to justice, democracy and the rule of law.

The requirements for registering marks, infringement and defences, and the elements of passing off will be canvassed, as will policy debates over the scope of legal protection. The second is the law of patents, which protects new innovations. It will cover the acquisition, ownership, exploitation and enforcement of patent rights and look at emerging issues such as the protection of biotechnology. The third is the action for breach of confidence, which protects trade secrets and personal information.
Intellectual Property 1 and Intellectual Property 2 can be taken in any order.
Please be aware that students who take Intellectual Property 1 and/or Intellectual Property 2 will not be able to take LAWS3021 Foundations of Intellectual Property Law and/or LAWS3057 Advanced Intellectual Property Policy and Practice.

JURD7449,Summer Term 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"This unit explores the emerging complexity of the relation between Law and Biology in the 21th century. It examines the following question: What does the concept ""biology"" do in legal descriptions of events in the world. Law not just regulates, allows, or limits what can be done or undone biologically but it also defines or alters our philosophical, political or social self-understanding. Both law and biology are meaningful structures which define, diagnose, and create concepts of persons as ""nature"", ""bodies"", ""organism"", ""groups"" or ""life"" (to name just a few). ""Law and Biology"" aims to provide a historical, analytical, and critical reflection on the legal implications of biological or biologized legalities.
The unit complements other units offered at the law school such as Legal Theory, Law and Social Theory, and Theories of Law and Justice. Similar to these units, Law and Biology has an emphasis on theoretical and critical aspects of the topic and relates law to an interdisciplinary field of knowledge and legal practices. The unit also relates to units such as Law and Medical Health or Intellectual Property Law which connect law with the biomedical or biotechnological field. The main difference with the theory electives is that Law and Biology takes place in an entirely different context, the field of biology, and that its focus is on theorizing law in the contemporary world where biolegitimacy increasingly takes hold. The difference with the other units is that the Law and Biology unit does not focus on matters of litigation. Instead, it opens up a broader and theoretical horizon both in the ways law itself can be understood and how it is connected to biology and science as a method. This connection will be explained through historical, analytical and legal insights and will include reflections on the scientific and ethical questions this relation provokes in the contemporary legal system. 
Students wishing to think about law “outside the box"" and who are interested in developing a rich theoretical and interdisciplinary perspective on law combining insights from philosophy, biology, technology, sociology, neurology, psychology and ethics will surely enjoy this course.It is recommended that students have some knowledge in legal theory through having taken one of the legal theory prescribed electives before enrolling in this course. No pre-existing knowledge of biology is necessary.

Control over the entry, stay and rights of non-citizens is a defining feature of State sovereignty and allows a State to determine the boundaries of the membership of its political community. 
The course adopts a thematic and theoretical approach to examining the legal regulation internationally and by States of the entry and stay of migrants and the status and rights conferred on citizens and non-citizens. It begins with an analysis of the theoretical approaches to global movements of people, including the relationship between the international legal context, State sovereignty, border control and citizenship and individual rights. It then examines the power of the State to refuse entry to, detain and exclude migrants from its territory and to grant, deny or withdraw citizenship status as embodied in the policies and domestic laws of the State and the international legal context in which the movement of people takes place.
The course examines the legal frameworks adopted by States for managing migrant populations and the recognition of citizenship status from a variety of perspectives: theoretical and practical, historical and contemporary, comparative, constitutional, statutory and regulatory. It examines the key theoretical, socio-political, legal and practical questions underlying migration and citizenship law and policy globally.

JURD7554,Term 2 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"Trade remedies are the most popular area in international trade law practice and the most adjudicated at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). They are actions taken by governments to counteract “dumping” through antidumping measures, subsidies through countervailing measures, and unexpected increases in the volume of imports through safeguard measures, for the protection of domestic industries. A typical form of these measures is an imposition of additional import duties on the top of the standard ones. WTO members are free to resort to trade remedies but must follow the relevant WTO rules.
This course offers a comprehensive and detailed study of the laws and practice of trade remedies. It studies the rationale for trade remedies; the domestic law and practice in selected countries with a focus on Australia (as an active user of trade remedies) and China (as a major target of trade remedies worldwide); the relevant WTO rules and major dispute settlement cases; negotiations of reforms of WTO rules on trade remedies; and the regulation of trade remedies under free trade agreements (FTAs). The course offers abundant opportunities for students to gain legal expertise and practical experience through case studies, simulation, and face-to-face discussion with leading trade and commercial lawyers.

JURD7596,Term 3 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"This course will teach students how to design legal information systems, integrating expert systems, hypertext, text retrieval and other technologies, for use in generating legal documents from precedents and assisting users to navigate solutions to legal problems. After learning the necessary skills, students will work in small groups, in partnership with a not-for-profit centre or organisation, to design and build a legal information system.
In class, students will also be exposed to a variety of examples of automation of legal tasks, and the various legal and practical issues associated with their use, including issues of professional regulation. This will include guest lectures from those working on legal expert systems and related technologies. Students will also become familiar with theoretical approaches to legal information systems development, and the range of technologies and approaches that may contribute to applications development.
Designing legal information systems requires students to think through a class of legal problems in a structured way. Systems can be used to generate legal documents from precedents, with variations based on the responses of a user, as well as to answer legal questions within a particular field. They are one component of the increasing tendency to automate legal tasks. Used well, legal information systems can facilitate access to legal information and expertise, but always within the limits of their designer's foresight. Designing a good legal information system thus requires skills in legal analysis and problem-solving, as well as the ability to think creatively and explore different approaches to a problem.
This course does not require students to have any pre-existing skills or experience in expert systems or computer programming - the course itself includes instruction on how to use expert system software.

The lecturers do not assume students have had any previous exposure to competition law in any of these jurisdictions or to the study of economics. The course looks at the meaning of competition; the rights and obligations of actual or would be competitors; the role that competition law is generally expected to play in society and the nature of markets and marketing power. All these issues are examined in a global context since businesses of all sizes are increasingly operating across borders and may be forced to modify their conduct and tailor their marketing and distribution systems to fit quite different competition regimes.

Intellectual property is an important area of commercial legal practice and is vital to many industries. This course introduces students to the statutory provisions and common law relating to Australian intellectual property. For each topic, the course gives consideration to the subject matter that is protected, the preconditions for protection, and the nature of infringement. Other matters (such as remedies, competition law and international protection) may be dealt with briefly but are not examined in detail.
As far as possible in an intensive overview, this course focuses on the commercial and business aspects of intellectual property. By the end of the course, students should be able to identify copyright, trademark and passing off, designs and patent law issues, and make an informed decision about how to proceed in advising a client. 
This course meets pre-requisite requirements for LAWS3057/JURD7357 Advanced Intellectual Property Policy and Practice, which is recommended for students who seek to further their knowledge of intellectual property policy issues and/or to deepen their skills applying intellectual property law in practice.

Lawyers practice within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Citizens live, and the laws operate, in societies in which specific social arrangements, structures, roles, expectations and conceptions of what is possible and what is right, are widely held and shape our views about law and about society. Customarily, most of us think within these categories and arrangements, rather than about them.
Theoretical investigation of those arrangements and understandings has to do with what underlies them. It is concerned to look beneath what we take for granted, to see what accounts for it, what its nature is, how it works and how it changes. Social theory is concerned to ask such questions about societies in which people live. Investigations about theories of law and society will lead us beyond our original and usually quite unreflectiveviews of what is important in law, what functions itplays, what it is for, whose interests it serves and how it serves them, what causes legal change and how important law is in society. In probing these questions we might come to confirm, modify or abandon our original assumptions; we will always, however, find these assumptions are more problematic, controversial and puzzling than they appeared at first to be.
 
This course is designed to introduce students to theoretical issues concerning the intricate and complex relationships between law and society. It seeks to do this by acquainting them with several important ways of approaching these issues, and with the sorts of questions best (and worst) addressed by each of these approaches.

The course materials are composed of two interlocking parts, each of which seeks to introduce students to a distinct range of questions—and a distinct way of asking such questions—about socio-legal relations.
 
Part 1—Law and Modernity: Classical Social Theory on Law in Modern Society
 
Classical social theory was born in nineteenth century Europe, that is, at a time and in a place which was undergoing massive and unprecedented social, economic, scientific and intellectual change. The early social theories differed markedly from each other, but they agreed upon one thing: the modern west was developing in ways and at a pace which were unprecedented in European history, and unparalleled anywhere else in this world. This so-called “great transformation” formed the context and topic of classical social theory. It prompted questions which had not been considered as urgently or directly before.

Among these are large questions about how people can and should be expected to behave, how increasingly large and complex societies “hang together”; and what differentiates one form of society and legal order from another. Typically the law presupposes that it has the answers to such questions. But in fact these questions have a form and structure that are not amenable to traditional legal analysis: a fact which renders lawyers, who are exercising their own specialised techniques, not especially expert in answering them. Listed immediately below are some of the questions that engaged the attention of the classic founders of modern social theory and which will be covered in the course.
 
 
 
 

1. What social functions do legal systems in general play, and what functions do specific types of legal systems play?
 
2. Is law necessary (or even beneficial) for orderly social life, or is it better to dispense with it?
 
3. What are the major influences on the nature of the law and legal systems and on change in them—economic, political or internal legal imperatives; the inte",72 UOC of JURD courses.,6 Units of Credit
JURD7633,Term 3 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"The Criminal Trial is a course that grounds the study of the criminal trial by contextualising the impact of the law of evidence and advocacy practice while building on students' basic knowledge of the doctrine, principles and rules relating to criminal litigation. It builds on and extends students' studies in criminal law, criminal procedure, the law of evidence, legal profession and various clinical and experiental law courses, including Kingsford Legal Centre. It does this by providing a multidisciplinary framework that explicates the role of participants in the criminal trial process. Classroom discussion focuses on commentaries examining a variety of issues associated with the dynamics of criminal trials. These issues vary from year to year, allowing for topical themes to be developed but they include comparative analysis, human rights principles and various multidisciplinary  perspectives including, the observations of historians, psychologists, sociologists, architects and linguists. A practice-orientation is an important component of the course as it assists to develop the rhetoric/reality theme that guides the course. It is fulfilled through guest speakers such as barristers and trial judges and through students fieldwork obligations.  Outside classroom hours students must attend and observe criminal trials in progress. This observation requirement is built into the final assessment, which is an essay based comparing the conduct and practices of participants in observed trials with what the law expects, requires or assumes exists in relation to those participants.
Outside classroom hours students must attend and observe criminal trials in progress. This enables students to not onlylearn about trial practice first hand but, with classroom discussion and the readings, better appreciate its relationship todoctrinal theory. The observation requirement is also built into the final assessment, which is an essay-based analysiswith a choice between two topics. One topic asks students to compare the conduct and practices of participants inobserved trials withwhat the law expects, requires or assumes. The other (alternate) topic requires students to explore a miscarriage of justicescenario of their own choice. Finally, a number of guest speakers, such as barristers and trial judges, will contribute to thecourse.

China opened up its economy to market forces only in the late 1970s. When it did so, law and the legal system lost the pariah status they had been given during the Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The course examines the role law plays in modern China by reference to its historical antecedents. It looks at particular areas of development, not only for their own sake, but also as indicators of the changing role of law in Chinese society. Areas that are the subject of particular attention include: elements and institutions of the Chinese legal system; the role of law in Chinese society from the perspectives of legal history and philosophy; contract law; intellectual property law; foreign investment law; corporate and securities law; foreign trade law; and mediation, arbitration and civil enforcement procedures.
In addition to classroom teaching, there will be field trips to Chinese legal institutions, such as a Chinese court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, an arbitration commission, and/or a Chinese law firm.

Modern agriculture is industrialised and food production corporatized. However, across the globe, there is a growing movement to reconnect with food production and to critically examine how food reaches our tables. Researchers and food activists are highlighting the social, cultural, ethical and environmental costs of modern food production, and exploring alternatives to industrial food systems.

Regulatory models that affect food production and distribution, including international covenants on food security and food aid, environmental laws, patents, trademarks, cultural heritage laws, biotechnology and health standards, animal rights, consumer laws and local government/planning law;
Biotechnology and food production, including the demise of historical prohibitions on agricultural patents and public interest litigation around patenting life forms; the distinction between discovery and invention and its consequence; the distinction between open-pollenated seeds, hybrids and GMOs; contemporary developments in agribusiness and biotech patenting; plant variety rights; seed saving and farmers’ rights; 
The environment and food, including the environmental impact of nutrient and pesticide pollution, biodiversity loss and deforestation, water overuse, carbon emissions and waste; legal and regulatory regimes designed to respond to these challenges, illustrated through case studies such as the pollution of the Great Barrier Reef by agriculture run-off; the regulation of water use in agriculture (70% of the world’s water) and in the food chain (two thirds of our total water footprint), including legal rights to surface and groundwater, water planning, allocations, efficiency approaches, markets, pricing and enforcement. 
Aboriginal science and rights to food, including an Indigenous Knowledges perspectives on science, agriculture and property rights to water, land, plants and animals, and data sovereignty; the regulation and use of this knowledge, including global initiatives around biopiracy; access and benefit sharing agreements; creative commons licensing; traditional knowledge databases; regional WIPO initiatives;

Innovative technologies include robotics, cryptography, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and smart contracts. These technologies are being applied to provide more affordable, accessible and inclusive financial services. These technologies will also deliver more effective financial regulatory solutions. However, the FinTech revolution also poses new challenges to policymakers, regulators and legal practitioners because it brings increased risks particularly in the areas of consumer protection and data privacy.
Laws underpinning financial regulation will need to be adjusted to remain responsive and relevant. Contemporary regulatory approaches, such as ‘Regulatory Sandboxes’, need to be implemented in a way which balances innovation, risk mitigation and financial inclusion.
This course will provide students with a basic understanding of the FinTech revolution and the implications for financial law and regulation (including RegTech).
The course will focus on market developments and regulatory trends which are being shaped by, and are themselves shaping, the FinTech revolution.
