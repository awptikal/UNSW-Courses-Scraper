ARTS1270,Term 2 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"Subject Area: History
How did the modern world happen? How did a few small countries in Europe (and later the United States) come to dominate so much of the world’s wealth and power by 1900? How did they displace the great empires of the Middle East, South Asia and China? Between 1400 and the beginning of the twentieth century, an astonishing, global revolution took place. We call it ‘modernity’. Human beings moved from villages to cities, from face-to-face communities to vast and bewilderingly complex societies. Nations and nation-states replaced the great empires and grand monarchies. Political ideologies and racism had become as deeply ingrained in people’s minds as the traditional religions. Towards the end, electricity and fossil fuels replaced human and animal muscle power, and machines drove peoples and things across the seas, over land and into the air. ARTS1270 Global History explains the making of the modern world to 1900.

Today, news headlines are dominated by the rise of populist leaders like Donald Trump, by stories of ethnic and racial tensions, political violence, war and conflict (especially in formerly colonised regions). The post-cold war period has witnessed the concentration of global wealth into fewer and fewer hands, Asia’s return to the centre of world power, the rise of individualism and hyper-consumption, and a crisis of borders (most recently typified by Brexit and refugee crises), and as we face unprecedented environmental crisis, fuelled by global capital. How can history help explain such phenomena?
In History of the Present, you will explore how colonialism and decolonization, modernity and tradition, communism, fascism and liberalism, the rise of feminisms, the intensification of global exchanges, and environmental developments in the twentieth century profoundly shaped the present. We will focus on a ‘long twentieth century’ timeframe, starting with the Great War and ending with yesterday, to explore historical concepts such as continuity and change, significance and controversy.

This course can also be studied in the following specialisation: Asian Studies
Development is everywhere. Everyday, all over the world from small villages to entire regions, social, political, and economic changes take place in the name of development. Yet, what is development and why does it matter? In this course we think of development as change; change driven by particular ideas about what a good life should be. Communities all around the world are subject to policies and projects that seek to change their lives for the better. Some succeed, some do not. Some are designed locally, some are designed much further away. Some are the result of shared ideas about what makes human life better while others are challenges to the way things are and call for dramatic changes to society. In this course we explore what drives development interventions, the ways it impacts communities, and the ways they respond. 
Through a series of 10 questions that form the content of the 10 week course, you will learn why development thinking – and by extension development practices – has changed over time, and the extent to which its architects have learnt from past failure and successes. You will be exposed to a variety of geographic case studies to see how development works (or doesn't) on the ground. You will leave this course with an appreciation about the complexities of development and with a solid foundation of what has been learned from past failures and successes.",No Prerequisites,6 Units of Credit

Contemporary Europe in Crisis: Power and Culture explores the unprecedented challenges facing contemporary Europe, through academic analysis, political commentary, film and novels. The processes of economic and political integration, heralded by the European Union, are under existential threat, and nationalism is on the rise. To the west, British disaffection with perceived loss of sovereignty has led to a referendum passing 'Brexit', indicating the intention of a member state to leave the EU for the first time. To its south, Europe is dealing with a refugee crisis brought on by wars in north Africa and the Middle East. On its Eastern flank, tensions with Russia are heightened, especially over Ukraine. The relationship of Europe with the USA in the era of Donald Trump's presidency is also in flux. All this is taking place while Europe has been reeling from the global financial crisis, with stringent austerity measures in some countries leading to great social deprivation and political unrest. This has created a resurgent right wing, which blames Europe's ills on immigrant populations, especially the Islamic community. Europe pressingly seeks to reconcile its liberal and secular ideals with the competing demands of nationalism and religious fundamentalism. This course will introduce the social, cultural and political crisis in contemporary Europe through a cultural lens.",No Prerequisites,6 Units of Credit
ARTS1810,Term 1 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"Subject Area: Politics and International Relations
Where does power lie in politics? Whose explanations about how the world works are valued and why? This course will equip you with some of the skills necessary to begin formulating your own answers to these questions. You will be introduced to the idea of studying politics, both domestic and international, as an academic discipline, and to some of the key academic conventions and standards that are important to the discipline: the idea of evidence-based argument, for example, and the idea of ethical scholarship. We will also discuss the formation of the modern state system and interrogate the conceptualisation of the state that informs much contemporary theory and practice in politics at the national and international level.
A substantial part of this course is devoted to the introduction of the main theoretical traditions that animate the study of politics and international relations. One of the central messages of the course is that different theoretical approaches generate different images of the world that build on particular assumptions. Therefore, while people may think they know what the current problems of politics and global politics are and how to solve them, one of the aims of this course is to alert you to other ways of seeing things. This should allow you to make a more confident decision about your own stance towards particular issues and to analyse these issues more thoroughly, but it should also make you question both your own and others’ representations of the world.",No Prerequisites,6 Units of Credit

In doing so, the course also introduces you to some of the different ways in which Politics and International Relations scholars seek to analyse these issues, giving you the opportunity to develop the skills of analysis needed for more advanced study in Politics and International Relations. At the conclusion of the course, you will have developed an appreciation of the scope and significance of the study of contemporary global politics, and some of the strengths and limitations of existing ways of analysing some of the most pressing problems facing the world.",No Prerequisites,6 Units of Credit

This course introduces you to the wave of experimentation in the arts that we have come to call modernism. During the first forty or so years of the twentieth century, traditional art forms underwent an unprecedented process of revolution and innovation, as artists and writers sought radically new ways to express the experience of modernity. We will consider the works of a range of individual European and North American modernist writers and film-makers, as well as examining some of the many collective movements, groupuscules and “isms” that sprang up during this period. A touchstone of our inquiry will be the vexed relationship between “modernity” as a historical condition and “modernism” as a cultural movement. What does it mean to be modern? What happens to art when traditional beliefs and ways of life enter a period of permanent crisis – a  period, that is, when “all that is solid melts into air”? And does modernist culture teach us ways to feel at home in modernity, or does it remind us of our alienation?",Prerequisite: 24 units of credit at Level 1,6 Units of Credit

In 1820, the poet Goethe coined the term ‘world literature’ as an expansive way of thinking about the circulation of texts around the globe, and the new forms of being in the world that were being traced by them. Two centuries later, Goethe’s phrase is taking centre-stage again, speaking to the very different globalised present of our own time.  Taking a range of compelling literary texts (contemporary novels, poetry and drama) as a starting point, this course invites you to explore this notion of ‘world literature’ and to investigate related ideas of literary ‘world systems’ and global structures of literary production, translation and recognition.   You will think in some detail about literary language, form and genre as a way of first approaching formulations of the ‘local’ and ‘locality’, and then establishing related questions of diverse cultural, linguistic and literary contexts. 
 The course is organised into two modules: ‘Water’ and ‘Land’. This geographical focus will support the scope of your reading and foster discussion within and across certain formulations of the ‘world’ literary canon.  You will think about questions of global movement and situated belonging, as well as current literary engagements with areas of urgent concern: vulnerable bodies, territorial conflict, ecology, the city and the animating question of global centres and peripheries.

Film genres are more than the mechanism of classification based on subject matter that we associate with the western, the horror film, the musical, etc. From producers to consumers, from studio moguls to directors, to critics, fans and aficionados, the notion of genre is used as a key determinant of a film’s meaning. Genre films work within and have the opportunity to reflect on society’s primary myths of identity and individuality, freedom and responsibility, cultural stability and social change. This course will consider some of the most fascinating questions raised by genre films: What are the parameters for standardization and innovation within film genres?

In particular, you will develop the ability to navigate the relationship between two sorts of ‘play': a script and a performance. The course combines exercises in literary analysis of written text, with a consideration of performance conventions and signification in theatre production. Through a lecture series and seminars that incorporate rehearsed readings and evidence from productions, you will become familiar with a broad range of highly-regarded plays from antiquity to the present day. You will investigate the relationship of these plays to the contexts in which they were first staged and to our contemporary world. You will also have opportunities to analyse and intervene in the processes of canon formation.

The election of Donald Trump to the United States presidency highlights gaping rifts in the society and politics of the contemporary United States. Decades of increasing inequality, globalisation and cultural conflict between religious conservatives, libertarians and what Americans call 'liberals' have left American politics and society more divided than it has been for half a century. At the same time, the United States remains the world's greatest power, exercising an enormous say in global governance, from economics to the environment. This course explores key elements in the making of Trump's America. Focusing particularly on the peculiar 20th-century US histories of class, race, religion and global engagement, you will learn how the world's oldest liberal democracy has become such a vital and fraught force in the contemporary world.",Prerequisite: 24 units of credit at Level 1,6 Units of Credit

In this course you will study the history of British colonialism and the movement for independence in India, focussing on the key question: if the struggle for freedom in India was conducted along Gandhian lines according to the principles of non-violence, then how can we understand the extent of violence that accompanied decolonisation, in 1947? The course answers this question by moving beyond the dominant tropes of the British Raj, replete with civilising missions, bejewelled maharajas and tiger hunts, to present a critical interrogation of colonial dynamics, demonstrating the relationships between imperial oppression, anti-colonial violence and Gandhian nonviolence, which culminated in the independence of India and the creation of East and West Pakistan, in 1947. The course engages with narratives of imperialism embedded in contemporary and historical popular cultures, from Raj Nostalgia to Bollywood film, seeking to align these with academic and public debates about history. We will reflect on the legacies of violence and nonviolence in India, and on the enduring impact of imperialism in the region.",Prerequisite: 24 units of credit at Level 1,6 Units of Credit

This course focuses on interactions among China, Korea, and Japan; their relations with the West; and the issue of culture and civilization in the post-nation-state era. The course is organized thematically. It starts by framing East Asia in terms of its history of globalization through cultural and religious interaction. The course then turns to fundamental cultural commonalities centring on statecraft, institutions, education and notions of civilization that united and divided the region. Cross cultural comparisons among China, Japan, and Korea highlight the global and regional dimensions of cultural change in East Asia. These frame cultural similarities and differences that influenced the varying approaches to modernity taken by Chinese, Japanese and Korean activists when East Asia came under increasing pressure from the West. The formation of nation-state ideologies along Western lines led to evolving conceptions of their place in the world, the meaning of culture, the role of commerce, and the relationship of the individual to the state. But in the era of globalization, these issues are situated in a post-nation-state framework.
The course thus concludes with East Asia's contributions to globalization.This course is taught in English and with readings in English.",Prerequisite: 24 units of credit at Level 1,6 Units of Credit

This course can also be studied in the following specialisation: Development Studies
Human society has experienced remarkable change as technological innovation, economic growth and population have produced rapidly changing social and environmental landscapes over the past current centuries. Such development is often seen a synonym of progress; however, over the past few decades it has been increasingly recognised that such rapid change has produced an uneven social geography – marginalising significant populations – while also intensively degrading and polluting different environments. We will discuss how the idea of sustainable development has emerged as a response to this conundrum – an effort to redirect economic growth to produced more socially just and environmentally benign outcomes. The path to a sustainable future, however, is not straightforward, as environmental, social and economic issues are ultimately situated in contested political realms. In this course, you will study how human-environment interconnections, across different scales and in different contexts, come together to demonstrate how environmental issues are situated in, and shaped by political and economic contexts. This will include engaging with a number of key sustainability debates as well as the in-depth study of different examples from around the world.",Prerequisite: 24 units of credit at Level 1,6 Units of Credit

Climate change is often understood as primarily a scientific or environmental problem that requires economic or technological solutions. In this course we will explore how climate change is perhaps better understood as a social, cultural and political phenomenon which is remaking the ways in which we understand our relationship with the Earth. How we understand climate, weather, nature and the environment are crucial for understanding contemporary global warming and our responses to it. We will examine the underlying politics of climate change. You will garner a conceptual and methodological toolkit for interpreting and making sense of the social aspects of climate change and the often intense political arguments that surround it. The course explores the history of climate science and the more recent emergence of a global consensus on anthropogenic global warming. The course goes on to consider recent work on abrupt climate change, climate modelling and the politics of climate change adaptation and mitigation technologies. The course draws on a multi-disciplinary framework for understanding the social, historical and political aspects of climate change, with insights from politics, sociology, and science and technical studies (STS).

Nothing is more human than to think that reality gives us knowledge. Nothing is more human than to wonder what, if anything, is real. When philosophy seeks to understand these fundamental and vital aspects of people and the world, we gain both an epistemology and a metaphysics. Some metaphysical topics that the course might explore include these: what it is to be a person; what it is to have a free will (if indeed anyone ever does); whether there is, or even could be, a supremely good and knowing and powerful god; whether there is any meaning to human life; whether there is any harm in death as such; and what makes two different individual things able to be examples of one kind of thing. Some epistemological issues that the course might explore include these: what it is for a thought or claim to be true; what it is for a thought or claim to be rationally well supported; what it is for a thought or claim to be knowledge; what it is to have knowledge via the senses; what it is to have knowledge purely via reason; and whether it might be impossible for us ever to have any knowledge or rational support at all.",Prerequisite: 24 units of credit at Level 1,6 Units of Credit

Sex is a constant through time, but ‘sexuality’ has a history. By starting in the Ancient world, you will learn that people and societies have not always understood sexual behaviour to equate with a sexual identity, such as ‘homosexual’ or ‘heterosexual’. ‘Sexuality’ then is a modern phenomenon. To comprehend this, we will examine why masturbation suddenly became a very big ‘problem’ in the 18th century and why sex was increasingly regulated from the 19th century. We chart the growth of new forms of sexual knowledge and ponder feminist critiques of Freud and other sex ‘experts’. We wind up in the twentieth century, with not one but several sexual revolutions.

Jane Austen currently enjoys a cultural popularity rivaling that of Shakespeare. This course aims to take account of the abiding relevance of Austen's work in the early 21st century in two distinct but related ways. On the one hand, it focuses on Austen's juvenilia and novels as social and cultural products of their time. It examines how her works interact self-consciously with contemporary romantic, gothic and sentimental fiction as well as 'converse' with each other to form a dynamic and intellectually challenging body of work. On a more theoretical level, it explores the various components of Austen's literary style that allow her to speak to present-day readers: her use of irony, her ability to illuminate the subtle transformation of character over time, and her unique intermingling of romance and realism. Through these two lenses, the module demonstrates the continuing relevance of Austen's literary and moral worldview.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, English",6 Units of Credit

What do you want to be when you grow up? At some point during the eighteenth century, this question went from being more or less meaningless to one of the central preoccupations of Western literature and culture: the driving principle of countless—if not most—classic novels, and the occasion for many canonical works in other genres and media. The idea that the shape of an individual life follows a basic pattern of development, leading from the open-ended possibility of youth to the stable identity of adulthood, seems self-evident to us, but this idea has a history: it has been figured, configured and reconfigured in many different ways over the past 250 years, and continues to mutate and develop under our eyes today. The aim of this course is to track the related ideas of youth, adulthood and development over this period, as they are represented in key works of literature and cinema, and especially within the genre of the Bildungsroman. Our inquiry will be guided by the assumption that narratives of development, in prose, poetry and film, are not only passive reflections of reality, but rather that these literary and film representations are essential tools for making sense of our time-bound lives. Accordingly, your engagement with these questions will take the form of class discussion and a traditional essay, but also an original narrative in which you implement your understanding of the genre. The course is designed as a history of ideas and representations, but also as a toolkit, which will help us think about what it means to come of age in our own society and how best to approach the problem of education.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, English",6 Units of Credit

The famous 20th Century philosopher Gilles Deleuze wrote in his books on cinema that ‘it is not sufficient to compare the great directors of cinema with painters, architects or even musicians. They must be compared to thinkers’. But what does it mean to think cinematically? In the wake of the decline of film theory as the unifying methodology of the discipline of film studies and the emergence of film-philosophy as one of several new approaches, this course identifies the question of the nature of film’s thought as a concern that dates back to the inception of cinema. Focusing on the kinds of ‘thinking’ undertaken by some of the ‘great directors’ in the history of cinema—including work by Eisenstein, Chaplin, Hitchcock, Dreyer, Welles, Rossellini, Sirk, Kubrick, Tarkovsky, Von Trier, and Malick—the course will introduce you to the diversity of contemporary approaches to the question of cinematic thinking (psychoanalytic, cognitivist, semiotic, philosophical) and to the work of the two most eminent philosophers of film: Stanley Cavell and Gilles Deleuze. A large part of the course will be devoted to reading key sections of Deleuze’s ambitious study Cinema 1: The Movement-Image and Cinema 2: The Time-Image and working through his major theses.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, Film Studies",6 Units of Credit

Media and climate change have had a long, entangled relationship. Media play key roles in the sciences of climate change themselves. For example, climate change sciences use computer modelling extensively, and also rely on global media networks that both circulate environmental data and allow for collaboration and discussion among scientists. Media also play a role in bringing climate change science to the public. In the process, media help frame the way climate change is discussed. Media thus play a fascinating if often conflicted series of roles in setting key social and political agendas with regard to climate change. On the other hand, dealing with climate change has challenged the way that media work. The mainstream media has had to change its approach to what counts as news, and to the way it sets agendas. Journalists have had to grapple with complex science in new ways. At the same time, newer media technologies such as social media and blogging platforms have augmented and often by-passed more traditional media platforms. This has transformed communications around environmental issues such as climate change. All this has created an increasingly complex setting both for the communication of science and for political communication around issues such as climate change. You will gain insight into the history, present and future of the increasingly important relations between media and climate change. You will explore the ways in which climate change issues are taken up in media and communications theory, in everyday and working life, and in practices such as journalism, science, documentary making, online discussion and political communication.","Prerequisite: 48 uoc overall, including 6 uoc at level 1 and 6 uoc at level 2 in one of the following streams, MCT.

From election campaigns to radicalisation; from transnational personal relationships to gaming; from the constitution of the global economy to online dating; media technologies play a crucial role. They have the potential to create social and political change as well as to disrupt personal lives in ways unimaginable a decade or so ago.
In this course you will examine current, ‘live’ topics in media, using relevant concepts and frameworks to investigate and understand present-day media-related issues. During the course, you will be encouraged  to capture and study media-related events and developments as they unfold. At the beginning of the semester three to four significant, exemplary, on-going topics, news stories, or developments involving the media will be chosen. The rest of the semester, including lectures and tutorial readings and discussions, will be organised around two to three broad themes that are based on the chosen topics.
The key focus will be on the application of relevant theories, frameworks and concepts on these topics, and an exploration of appropriate methodologies for their analysis. The topics covered could include, for instance, digital media affordances, political communication as public strategy, online radicalisation, social media use and counter-publics, the political economy of IT industries, or surveillance and security, covering the themes of media in the public domain and media in the private domain, as well as the intersections of the two. The methodologies discussed could, in turn, include textual analysis and deconstruction, auto-ethnography, and conjunctural analysis. The emphasis will be on situating media analysis and theory within broader socio-cultural and political contexts.","Prerequisite: 48 uoc overall, including 6 uoc at level 1 and 6 uoc at level 2 in one of the following streams, MCT.

What makes contemporary Spain such a fascinating place is the immense and frenetic change it has undergone and that has, many argue, produced a new country. In less than half a century, a predominantly rural, agricultural society has been transformed into a mainly urban and technological one. A 40-year dictatorship has become a democracy. One of the world's most centralised states has been made into one of the most decentralised. A society that was intensely sexually repressed has become a notably permissive one. There has been a revolution in the roles of men and women. And, Spain has experienced a surge in immigration that has turned it, in the space of just a few years, into a multi-ethnic society. In this context of change, the topics explored in the course include nationalism and national identity, literary production, the arts, media, gender and sexuality, Europeanisation, languages and regionalism, religion, and fiestas.

Are you interested in understanding and tackling important environment-development challenges in the 21st century? Do you think a community-based approach to development and environment management delivers more sustainable and equitable outcomes? The course interrogates these and many more critical questions surrounding the community-based approach to development and environmental management. The course exposes you to a sophisticated understanding of the current development and environment issues affecting the well-being of local communities in Australia and developing countries. Specifically, the course provides you with the necessary theoretical background as well as a set of case studies to understand and tackle real-world environmental and development challenges. Through this course, you will have an opportunity to integrate social, economic and environmental aspects of development and environmental issues, and the concepts are discussed through the lens of sustainable development from a societal perspective. Ideas and issues are presented as contested entities because of the multiplicity of diverse, and at times, diametrically opposed stakeholder interests. The approach of the course, therefore, eschews the “one right way” approach to development and environment management in favour of an approach based on understanding the diverse and complex societal contexts in which development and environment professionals operate. Different approaches to managing the environment and development projects and programs are illustrated throughout by means of relevant case studies. You will be able to explore whether and how different policies and practices are working (or not working), and how policy responses can be made more equitable and sustainable at the community level.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, Development Studies",6 Units of Credit

Germany has faced enormous challenges and undergone radical transformations since the end of the Second World War, when it was a defeated, occupied pariah with no central government. For forty years, the country was divided into communist East and capitalist West, until the fall of the Berlin Wall heralded the end of the Cold War. Since then, Germany has arguably become the European Union's leading power. This course explores social, cultural and political developments in Germany since 1945, with a focus on major contemporary and scholarly debates. You will learn about how Germans in the postwar period coped with defeat and occupation and sought a new beginning; and about social, political and generational change in East and West Germany, including the challenge of radical leftwing terrorism since the 1970s. You will also explore the difficulties of uniting East and West Germans since 1990; how Germany has handled the arrival and integration of migrants and refugees; and the country's ongoing quest to define its national identity and its role in Europe and the world.

ARTS3783 examines the foreign policies of a number of great and emerging powers, including the United States, China, India, Britain and France from 1945 to the present. In doing so, it focuses on the problems, threats and challenges that confronted these powers during the Cold War and in the period following the collapse of the old bipolar system; it assesses how these powers perceived these problems, threats and challenges, how they reacted to them and what policies they put in place to offset them. In addition, ARTS3783 analyses the geopolitical, military, economic and domestic constraints under which these powers acted and considers the economic and military capabilities they relied on in pursuance of their foreign policy objectives.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, Development Studies, International Relations, Politics, or Politics and International Relations",6 Units of Credit

Has Germany 'come to terms' with its Nazi past? How are Stalinism and the Soviet Union remembered in Putin's Russia? In this course you will explore how Europeans have coped with their recent pasts, particularly the experiences of fascism and Nazism, of World War II and the Holocaust, and of Soviet-style communism. You will be introduced to the interdisciplinary fields of 'transitional justice' and 'memory studies' in the context of contemporary Europe. You will examine attempts to achieve justice, to identify perpetrators, victims, collaborators and bystanders, to reconcile former enemies and ideological opponents, and to develop new, usable understandings of the past. You will study the many ways in which the past is addressed, including though trials and purges, through commemoration rituals, memorials, museums and monuments, through official histories and popular memories, as well as the public and scholarly debates that surround them. The course draws on cases from across Europe, including France, Germany, Poland, Russia and Spain, and considers the role of the European Union.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, European Studies or History; or 48 UOC overall, including 12 UOC in German Studies language courses",6 Units of Credit

The period from the early 1970s is often noted as a particularly volatile one for the global political economy (GPE). This volatility has significant implications for the ways in which we are able, or not, to live our lives today and for the future sustainability of political-economic practice. You will be asked in this course to work out what these implications are, and how they have arisen, by examining the global political economy in a variety of forms, and through multiple perspectives. You will be encouraged to think reflectively and imaginatively about questions in the GPE for which there are no easy answers, including questions of power, privilege, common sense, instability and the ongoing role of crisis-driven capitalist growth. You will be asked to make decisions about your views on the apparently systemic nature of capitalist instability. Together, we will decide to what extent, and why, the global political economy has been dominated by crisis, developing an understanding of the structure and practices of global political-economic relations, in historical and contemporary perspective.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, Development Studies, International Relations, Politics, or Politics and International Relations",6 Units of Credit

How are policymakers dealing with these emerging or 'new' security challenges, to what effect, and what are some of the alternatives? These are some of the key questions explored in this course, which investigates the broad and evolving agenda of security studies, and key themes and dynamics in contemporary security relations. Using a range of conceptual and theoretical frameworks, the course asks you to examine issues such as new forms of warfare, sexualized violence in armed conflict, migration and identity, food security, climate change, and nuclear proliferation, and question whether these constitute 'new' security challenges. It asks what the implications of such an approach are for security relations at the state-societal level; the scholarly field of security studies, and the practice of security in policymaking terms.

This seminar focuses on cultural identities – national, ethnic, religious and linguistic – in particular, and examines a range of scholarly and public debates provoked by these identities in seeming conflict. How should cultural identity fit within democratic states? Is the diversity associated with such identities compatible with the social solidarity needed for citizens to support collective goals like welfare programs? Do so-called nation-states have a right to protect their national identities and culture through restrictive immigration policies? Are liberal democratic states obliged to recognise the cultural identities and practices of its minorities? Should Indigenous groups be distinguished from immigrant groups? Should religious identity be treated differently from ethnic identity? Is multiculturalism bad for women, children, and animals? Should citizenship still be the foundation for addressing identity claims in democracies? By exploring how identities are constituted and situated in today’s highly mobile and interconnected world, this course asks how these identities shape world politics and offers you the opportunity to think carefully and reflectively about the relationship between various markers of identity and pressing questions in contemporary politics.

ARTS3822,Term 1 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"Subject Area: Politics and International Relations
The systematic study of politics has a long history, stretching back some two and a half thousand years to the ancient Greeks. Over the last century, however, it has become institutionalised and professionalised and, as the disciplinary name Political Science suggests, has sought to put the study of politics on a footing comparable to the aims, methods, and conventions presumed integral to the natural sciences. Yet the possibility, desirability, and even meaning of a “science of politics” are controversial issues. This course examines fundamental questions about what political knowledge is and how it is acquired. In the first weeks, you will explore in a general way what it might mean to be a “student of politics.” You will learn about the different fields of political science and examine the idea of a systematic and dispassionate study of anything. You will consider the modern history of the discipline and identify the different and often conflicting perspectives regarding the appropriate aims, scope, and methods of political inquiry. Thereafter, the course will proceed each week by examining in detail a particular analytical perspective in conjunction with a real-world case study: behaviouralism, marxism, interpretivism, institutionalism, rational choice theory, the structure versus agency problem, the relation between institutions, values and culture, and normative approaches.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, Politics and International Relations",6 Units of Credit

This course explores the rise of human rights discourse and its relationship to other discourses on suffering and social justice. It focuses on the experience of victims of human rights abuse and the politics of meaning. Students will engage in critiques of law as a reductionist discourse on the social by exploring the relationships between human rights and cultural differences such as gender, ethnicity, religion and indigenous cultures. The embodied self, social interdependency and the architecture of social institutions are the backdrop through which the course explores the tensions between universal and relativist understandings of human rights and their realization. Students will be introduced to the fundamentals of human rights, the global human rights machinery, and the ethics of humanitarian intervention, and will consider how sociologists and anthropologists have studied and written about human rights.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, Australian Studies, Development Studies, Globalisation Studies, orSociology & Anthropology",6 Units of Credit

In this course you will reflect on the practice of key social research methods for investigating culture and society. You will address the relationship between methods and methodology and recognise the importance of understanding the historical, theoretical and philosophical contexts from which particular research methods have emerged. Social researchers do not apply a set of neutral techniques to the issues they investigate, but rather research is part of a dynamic, engagement with social and cultural worlds with often deep connections to colonial thought and power. A heightened sense of the strategies used in researching culture and society enhances reflexivity among social researchers: that is, the capacity to reflect upon who we are, what we are doing; and the ethics of accountability. You will find that central to this course is the proposition that social research is a form of intervention in the social and cultural world, which may have major consequences on people’s lives. So too you will develop an understanding of your ‘subjective positioning’ and will come to find ways to decolonise your practice both through methods and methodologies. To do this you will engage with a wide source of information and knowledge and address decolonising principles and praxis.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, Australian Studies, Development Studies, or Sociology & Anthropology",6 Units of Credit

Individualized representations of violent events dominate medical and juridical rationalities, human rights practices and truth commissions, but this course will insist too on the collective and cultural nature of trauma. You will engage with a range of sources - ethnographic, literary, narrative, cinematic, musical and artistic – and you will be introduced to the ways scholars have theorized the experience and aftermath of mass violence, state terror, genocide and torture.

AVIA5001,Term 1 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"This course aims to provide students with an overview of the regulatory structure of civil aviation in
Australia. Aviation and the law share some basic similarities. Both the aviation and legal professions
are highly specialised and each require an extensive degree of training before one can be classed as
a “professional” within the respective disciplines. Although aviation professionals are highly trained
technicians or managers it does not follow that such training has necessarily included training in the
law and legal systems.

The fact that the aviation industry is a highly regulated and legislated sector provides an even greater
reason why today’s aviation professional should be conversant with, and knowledgeable of, the law
as it applies to the aviation industry. In most sections of the aviation industry there are no formal
requirements for training in the law or legal systems. Of course there is a myriad of rules and
regulations in aviation that must be known but that does not equate to training in statutory
interpretation or the like.

Aviation professionals, like their legal counterparts, spend a long time undertaking formal, structured
training. Then there follows years of practical, on-the-job training. In fact the training never really
ends. Both professions require ongoing professional training. Because of the extensive time taken to
“learn the profession” quite often people working in the aviation sector enter at an early age. It is not

AVIA5005,Term 1 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"This course is complementary to AVIA5009 Airline Corporate Management which is also provided in the MScTech (Aviation)/MAvMgmt program. The introductory module of this course provides a brief overview of the corporate side of airline management and its relationship with the following modules.
Airline operations are defined as the functional areas which are directly associated with the operations of the aircraft and in the provision of operational support services. There is much overlap between the management of “corporate” and “operational” aspects of an airline. This occurs mainly in the planning processes such as fleet planning, schedule planning, and strategic planning (including business plans
and annual budgets). These important processes will be covered in this course for the functional areas that play major roles in the airline.

Engineering and maintenance, airline airport operations, crew resource provision and inflight service functions are specifically covered in some detail. As well as those important functional areas, other airline processes are covered which play important roles in the operations. These include emergency planning, operations control, and punctuality management.

The more recent interest in outsourcing in airline management is looked at as airlines pursue the reduction in costs and head towards the “virtual” airline. There is a module on environmental matters in the airline and also a chapter on freight. Perhaps the latter is a little misplaced but those of you who do both the courses on Airline management should have some exposure to the freight part of the airline.
General management techniques apply to many of these functional areas. Planning, budgeting, staff and equipment rostering, and disruption management are generic but in this course are discussed from the airline’s view. The management of aircraft, crew (both technical and cabin service crew), and inflight service functions are complex, especially the impact each has on the other.

Modern jet transport systems now enable people to travel vast distances at high-speed, within a highly hazardous environment, yet paradoxically with minimal risk. A significant reason for this is the development of Safety Management Systems (SMS). Successful completion of this module is expected to equip the student with the theoretical knowledge of the requirements of a SMS as described by the
International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the Civil Aviation Authority (Australia) (CASA).
Another aspect of a modern SMS is the investigation of aircraft accidents and incidents. In the past, engineering solutions led to significant improvements. However, over time, such investigations revealed that accidents and incidents were often not the product of a single cause, but were more likely to have resulted from a combination of factors. Many of those factors were linked to the ways in which the behaviour of individuals was adversely influenced by task related and systemic conditions, which has led to a breakdown in safety. With the growing complexity of aviation passenger transport operations it has therefore become increasingly necessary to look beyond the actions of individuals in order to understand those system based, error-producing conditions that adversely influence their actions.
Safety management systems are now increasingly used by organisations to ensure that all aspects of their operations that could affect safety have been adequately addressed. Typically, such systems provide for:
• The establishment of organisational safety objectives and policy;
• A commitment by senior management to safety;
• The promotion of a positive safety culture;
• The identification of safety hazards and the management of risk;
• The means of measuring and maintaining organisational safety health:
• Procedures for the rectification of safety deficiencies; and
• Emergency response procedures.",No Prerequisites,6 Units of Credit

The investigation of aircraft incidents and accidents is now recognized as an essential component of an effective safety management system. By its very nature, an aircraft accident represents some form of failure of the aviation safety system. In many cases, valuable insights into the safety health of an organization can be gained by the effective use of proven incident / accident investigation techniques. Such investigations are necessarily ‘reactive’ but do provide a valuable ‘snapshot’ of how flight operations, maintenance practices and general company management was actually being conducted at the time of the event. When combined with a ‘proactive’ incident reporting and investigation program (now components of a Safety Management System) the often hidden factors that adversely influence the actions of operational personnel can be revealed.
The investigation techniques examined in this course are directed solely to the objective of accident prevention. The apportioning of blame or the determination of liability is not part of this process. In many cases, aircraft accident investigations are commenced in chaotic, stressful, and sometimes physically challenging situations. Such circumstances can place significant demands on investigators. It is at those very times that a thorough understanding of the process of investigation is essential to ensure that all elements are properly addressed during that initial phase.

Students will learn to do that effectively in a digital age where the content is easily accessed but the understanding of that information is harder to achieve. They will also learn how to measure the effectiveness of their communication of science. Understanding the art of evidence based science communication has become more important than ever before in a world where fake science news threatens our ability to communicate science effectively. 
For those students going on to a higher degree in science, a basic requirement of being a successful scientist is to be able to effectively communicate. However, very few scientists have had any formal evidence-based science communication education. Fewer still have been taught how new emerging communication technologies can engage audiences with science or how to use emotion and be personable when communicating science. This course prepares students for a career in their chosen science discipline.
The objective of BEES6800 is to help students to gain confidence in clearly communicating science and why it matters across multiple peer and public audiences in multiple modes, and via multiple digital technologies and media – including social media. 
The course is mostly online. 
There are two face-to-face weeks for which there will be an online equivalent of at least lecture recordings for students unable to attend in person. One of these two weeks will be an experience in the Mars Lab education and research facility at the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, and in which UNSW is a partner. The second will be a week of activities, including discussion and debate, on the issues of fake science news and miscommunication of science news.
Assessment will be through three connected online assignments that directly address course outcomes.These outcomes include understanding the nature and processes of science, being able to communicate science clearly with multiple audiences in multiple modes, understanding the best use of new and emerging technologies to communicate science, thinking critically and creatively, and knowing how to measure the effectiveness of science communication.

By undertaking Heritage Planning you will develop your appreciation and understanding of the physical and nonphysical
aspects of Australia’s heritage. The course will provide you with an introduction to the various statues that
apply to heritage within Australia and NSW. During the first half of the semester, we will cover the history of heritage
conservation in Australia, including the ICOMOS Burra Charter, and how heritage is identified, assessed and
managed at World, National, Commonwealth, and State and Local levels. Following mid-semester break, our focus
shifts and we concentrate on different aspects of our heritage including; cultural landscapes, Aboriginal and settler
archaeology, built heritage, cultural landscapes, interpretation and intangible values. Throughout the course you will
learn from experienced professionals working in the public and private sectors. They will present various disciplinary
perspectives including archaeology, architecture and landscape architecture. The guest lecturers will talk about their
‘real life’ experience of working in heritage in the context of the legislation and urban development in Sydney and
elsewhere.
Drawing on this professional experience, the course will canvass some of the different approaches to understanding
heritage and conservation. Many of these approaches are political and official, involving governments at international,
national, state and local levels. They are also formal and involve statutory planning processes such as identification,
assessment, listing via planning instruments and heritage registers, and provisions for permits and applications. In
each case, the approaches, solutions and outcomes for heritage projects vary based on political will, economic
issues, the formal protective mechanisms, professional judgments, subjectivity and community values.
The primary aim of the course is to ensure that as future professionals in the fields of urban planning, architecture and
landscape architecture, you develop a sound understanding of the theoretical, legislative, administrative and practical
aspects of heritage conservation that is grounded in ‘real world experience’. This, in turn, will enable you to gain an

In these contrasting contexts, you will use quick hand drawing, data collection and digital post production techniques to observe and analyse the dynamic layers of public street space: physical, behavioural and systematic. This on-field research will be used as evidence for the creation of an urban design proposal in response to a real-world challenge you have observed in the street sites.

Contextually, Phnom Penh streets are clear examples of diverse urban dwellers appropriating the public domain. In many Sydney streets, this kind of informal or unplanned activity is less apparent. What knowledge can be exchanged in comparing these contexts? How can we use interdisciplinary and cross-cultural collaboration to expand this? How can we draw from both the formal and informal dynamics of street space? How might we as designers use observational research methodologies to meaningfully contribute to city-making processes?

As a critical part of the design process the model expresses ideas and concepts in three dimensions with concern for materials, lighting, space and, nowadays, interactivity; in other words the model literally presents all of the components of a finished architecture. Traditionally architectural models have been hand-made which both reflected the building process of the time and a cultural longing by architects to be more directly involved in the production of their work (many architects design products, especially furniture, for the same reason). But for some time now architecture has been tending towards the assembly of factory made components; and, as can be seen across the world, factories tend towards automated machine-made production. It’s worthwhile to point out at this stage that beautiful things are created in factories. Porsche, Honda, Apple, Prada and Boeing (to name a few) all use factories to create amazingly sophisticated products; most for a fraction of the cost of the average architect designed building.   
If architectural models should reflect both the finished architecture and its mode of production they will need to employ automated processes such as digital modelling, laser cutting, CNC milling and rapid prototyping. However, this elective isn’t dogmatic; several hand-made processes will also be employed (hot-wire cutting blue foam, casting, sheet metal folding). In this elective students will be trained to use and have direct access to all of these machines.

Unfortunately, only a small proportion of people ever gain more than a superficial understanding of natural selection and how evolution works. And that can be problematic given the important insights that evolution provides into the most difficult and persistent problems that plague 21st Century living, including antibiotic resistance, obesity, overpopulation, income inequality, gender inequity and the ideological warfare that surround sex and family life.

The course is situated in the 'Beginner Level' in the CoDe student specialisation journey and therefore available for enrolment as an elective for all other UNSW undergrad students.
In the early nineties, the concept of the paperless studio and the integration of digital media into design practice; the 'digital turn', were considered to be merely experiments undertaken by the avant-garde. Today, computation is embedded in all aspects of design practice from conception to construction. New digital design techniques have been joined by new methodologies and formal outcomes. The representation of design has greater sophistication and we understand more about the effects of digital imagery. Computation has also infiltrated the construction of our built environment, from materiality to management. Highly complex information systems process, analyse and integrate components in 3D virtual spaces.
Computation is ubiquitous in our built environment, and its integration has had significant effect on the culture of the design and built environment. The interest we have in technology has moved beyond merely the creation of blob architecture into the new possibilities and challenges it offers to parametrics, sustainability and fabrication. This course will explore the elaborate relationship between computer, the designer and the design and construction of our built environment. The semester's lectures will help in better understanding the relationships and effect of the continual change and evolution on the social and cultural aspects of our design practices. A range of bridging theories essential to the 'digital turn' in building information management, information modelling, as well as the agency for simulation and optimization will be introduced. For example, pre-BIM design concepts; agency in architecture; visualization; materiality and material practice; robotics and making, BIM in practice and so on.
Students will have an opportunity to develop their understanding of ideas and issues through their participation in a critical discussion group. Theoretical understanding will be expanded and formalised through online activities and through illustrated writing exercises, which will be presented in class. The teaching strategy of the course positions students to the concept and theoretical formation of the digital design.",Prerequisite: CODE1110,6 Units of Credit

Particularly, this aims to unpack assumptions that ""technology is the simple application of science, and that technology is all for the good"" (Dusek 2006). This course will focus on four key questions (1) What is technology? How do we define it, study it, and understand it in relation to nature and society? (2) What is the impact of technology on society, culture, and ethics? How can we think about this impact? Where is technology beneficial, and where is it problematic?

COMM5201,Term 2 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"A social enterprise, broadly defined, is a 'for profit' organisation that has a social or environmental mission at the core of what it does. Whilst social enterprises might have different legal structures and reinvest or redistribute profits in different ways, they are all characterised by an integrated business model that enables their (social and/or environmental) mission to be realised through their direct business operations and not by business profits alone. Driven by the desire to find innovative solutions to systemic social problems and environmental challenges (local and global), social entrepreneurs have facilitated collaboration across traditional 'sectorial boundaries' (the public, private, and not-for-profit sectors) using business thinking to reach people in need and utilising markets for social good.  The aim of this course is to first introduce the key features of a social enterprise, examining the various, and at times contested, terminology used in social enterprise/social business contexts, and compare and contrast social enterprises to other enterprise forms (corporations, businesses, and charitable/benevolent organisations).  The course will then consider some of the challenges, constraints, and opportunities that social enterprises confront in pursuing their organisational mission (both social/environmental and financial) before examining how a social enterprise might be designed, launched, and scaled. In addition to developing foundational knowledge about social enterprises, the course will also focus on development presentation skills, in particular, how to pitch to potential investors an idea for 'doing business for social good'.",No Prerequisites,6 Units of Credit
COMM5202,Term 1 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"Social and environmental sustainability is increasingly viewed by businesses as a key to increased productivity, growth trajectory, and long term value creation. This is a result of both internal and external factors, including the drive for resource efficiency in a world of decreasing natural resources, the need to attract and retain staff, many of whom require their employer to act in a socially and environmental responsible manner, building a loyal customer base locally and abroad, and the responsibility to account for social and environmental impacts through voluntary and involuntary performance reporting.

What and how to measure, how to communicate outcomes and impact effectively, and how to manage the process of evaluation within an organisation are just some of the associated challenges. Beginning with an examination of ‘why measure’, this course will then turn to a practical application of ‘what and how to measure outcomes and impact’, how to communicate social and environmental measurement outcomes and impact to key stakeholders, and conclude with an assessment of how an outcomes and impact framework might facilitate organisations to deliver on their mission, support organisational learning, and provide capacity for organisational change and sustainability.",No Prerequisites,6 Units of Credit

COMP6721,Term 2 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"(In-)Formal Methods are practical structuring and design patterns that encourage programming that is easy to understand and to maintain. They are only a part of the large body of “good programming practices,” distinguished from that larger set because –for the methods we consider– the computer-science community has determined the science behind the structures: we know why they are effective.
Unusually, this course does not take the traditional route of teaching that science first, and then turning it into practical programming “tools-of-thought.” Instead, we teach the mental tools first, try them on examples and only then, once their effectiveness has been demonstrated, will we look behind the scenes to see where they come from.
Initially the material will deal with conventional programs, those that must “give the right output.” (This is known as functional correctness, and a sorting program is a simple example.) Later in the course we will look at additional correctness criteria, such as security (perform this calculation in a way that keeps part of the answer hidden) and randomisation (implement over-the-internet protocols that depend intrinsically on coin-flipping).

COMP6741,Term 3 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,1,"The course focuses on algorithms for exactly solving NP-hard computational problems. Since no polynomial time algorithm is known for any of these problems, the running time of the algorithms will have a super-polynomial dependence on the input size or some other parameter of the input.
The first part presents algorithmic techniques to solve NP-hard problems provably faster than brute-force in the worst case, such as branching algorithms, dynamic programming across subsets, inclusion-exclusion, local search, and measure & conquer. We will also see lower bounds for algorithms and how to rule out certain running times assuming the (Strong) Exponential Time Hypothesis.
Whereas the first part presents ""default"" algorithms that one would use without knowing much about the instances one is about to solve, the second part acknowledges that the complexity of an instance does not only depend on its size n. A parameter k is associated with each instance and the parameterized complexity framework aims at designing fixed-parameter algorithms whose running times are f(k)*poly(n) for a computable function f. This gives efficient algorithms for small values of the parameter obtained via techniques such as branching, colour coding, iterative compression, and kernelization (preprocessing).

This course provides an introduction to penology. It begins by considering the growing use of prisons across the developed world and is then constructed around three main themes: theorising the prison; perspectives for reform; and contemporary issues in Australian penal policy. The elective is designed to give students some insight into the frameworks used by social theorists to analyse imprisonment, with a view to examining contemporary issues such as ‘supermax’ prisons, deaths in custody, immigration detention, the civil rights of prisoners and prison privatisation. The experience of the New South Wales prison system following the 1978 Royal Commission into New South Wales prisons provides an immediate context for studying such issues and an opportunity to examine the complexities and limitations of prison reform.The course intends to focus on the wider sociological implications of imprisonment and to introduce students to the various perspectives on punishment and the prison system offered by social theorists. It is designed to encourage both a basic understanding of the core literature and the ability to apply different penological perspectives to original research.
A student who has successfully completed this course should be able to:understand some of the main themes within penology; understand the relationship of penology to criminology; appreciate the wider instrumental role of the prison in the criminal justice process; and contribute to more informed policy debate about prisons and punishment.",Prerequisite: 24 units of credit at Level 1 including CRIM1010 or CRIM1011,6 Units of Credit

This course examines the development of important institutions and procedures of criminal justice, and the debates they provoked from the 17th to the 19th century. Using early modern England as a focal point (but also referring to criminal justice in Europe), this course will introduce you to the major features of England’s criminal justice system. It asks: Why were so few criminals prosecuted and convicted in the 17th and 18th centuries? Why did punishments in this period – even for apparently minor crimes – seem to be so brutal and bloodthirsty? Why were executions carried out in public? We then consider some of the ways in which “reforms” were introduced during the 18th and 19th centuries: Why was the policy of transportation developed? What were the prison hulks? What changes were implemented in England’s prisons? How could the French Revolution’s famous innovation – the guillotine – be considered humane?

Prisoners, community-based offenders, and other detainee groups exert huge, social, health and economic impacts on the community and pose significant challenges for society. Those in contact with the justice system endure some of the worst health outcomes in the community in terms of mental illness, substance misuse, traumatic brain injury and infectious diseases (e.g. HIV and viral hepatitis). Many of these can be attributed to the social determinants of health and lifestyle factors including injecting drug use, alcohol abuse, sexual risk behaviours, body piercing, tattooing and violence. Contact with the justice system, including incarceration, presents an important opportunity to intervene and improve health outcomes of hard-to-access populations.Significant overlap exists between public health and criminology in terms of offender rehabilitation as the criminogenic needs of this population are also public health priorities that operate in a complex legal, human rights, research, and policy environment. In this course you will learn about the complex health needs of those in contact with the justice system and the importance of these for offender rehabilitation. Experts in this field (e.g. a former prisoner, prison administrator, prison doctor and prisoner support worker) will present and discuss the challenges and controversies in prisoner and offender health (e.g. harm reduction strategies in prison, treatment of the mentally ill in the justice system), researching offenders, ethical dilemmas, health service delivery in prison, and prevention and intervention strategies. A visit to a prison will provide an opportunity to reflect on some of these issues.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in Criminology.

This course will introduce you to some of the many tools that can facilitate creative thinking. The processes of analysis can help to extend possibilities beyond predictable outcomes, and the same thinking tool can be used across many different disciplines to create new, more integrated and original options and ideas. We will explore visual, verbal and physical ways of transforming ordinary ideas into fantastic ones. Using taught techniques such as the Synectic Pinball Game you will learn to understand more clearly what happens when the creative mind is at work.
We will test the principles of interconnectivity, bisociation (conceptual blending), non-linear (associative) thinking, and use maps, models and metaphors to develop your creative thinking through research, analysis and application of these models to your own ideas. Many famous creative thinkers have used a wide range of processes that we will critically explore and apply.
An important part of understanding and applying the creative process is an examination of how we learn, and how to facilitate the best possible conditions and environments for working in innovative and creative ways. The balance between strategic planning and goal-free approaches to creative processes will be analysed and discussed in relation to the applied research of Professor Teresa Amabile and Professor Tina Seelig amongst others.
Collaborative theory and practice have at their core the potential to extend and enhance outcomes in multi-disciplinary thinking.

While academic performance is important, the majority of graduate employers rated teamwork, cultural fit and interpersonal skills as “very important” - much higher ratings than academic grades. In 2018, the next most valued attributes were communication, motivational fit and problem solving skills. The transferable skills developed outside the classroom in community engagement, casual work and relevant work placements are the major factors that differentiate the best candidates.

FINS4792,Term 1 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"This postgraduate course critically evaluates models of financial markets (market microstructure) and examines how asset prices are established in actual markets such as the stock exchange based on actual trades.  It differs from asset pricing theory in which prices are assumed to be set such that supply and demand are equated via some costless auction-type frictionless mechanism that remains an undisclosed ‘black box’. Actual markets require actual rules and these rules affect the way in which prices are established, the way in which information possessed by traders is incorporated into asset prices, why some markets and stocks are liquid and why some markets are more fragile and costly than others.  
While this course is based on a relatively-new excellent text by three leading lights in the field, it is supplemented by a number of state-of-the-art studies that significantly advance our understanding of the role of different types of risk-volatility and illiquidity-in determining asset prices and the equity premium, for example, why it is that households can outperform professional investors?, how information contained in the stock price enables boards and CEOs to be monitored, and the role of counterparty transparency in improving market efficiency. Many of these papers are written by or with former students in the course.  
It first presents the basic modelling and tools used in the market microstructure field which analyses how prices are established in securities markets and whether or not markets are liquid. The course then analyses components of market design such as transparency and fragmentation (maker-taker fee structures and inverted markets, how investor heterogeneity leads to the (false?) rejection of asset pricing models, and how market design affects asset prices and corporate performance. 
This market microstructure course helps to address many of these fundamental issues, as well as equip students to read, understand and apply the rapidly developing market microstructure field in areas such as merchant banking. 
The goal of the course is to establish perspectives, approaches, tools and methods of independent thinking, analysis, and problem solving. Topics include exchange design rules, transparency and opacity, asymmetric information, private information, liquidity provision and pricing, volatility, transaction costs, strategic and noise trading, algorithmic trading, information and trading profits, dark pools, liquidity and returns. Three groups of traders are considered: domestic and foreign institutions and households. Households can be clients of either ‘full-service’ brokers or ‘discount’ brokers.

FINS5593,"Term 1 2019, Term 2 2019","Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"This postgraduate course critically evaluates models of financial markets (market microstructure) and examines how asset prices are established in actual markets such as the stock exchange based on actual trades.  It differs from asset pricing theory in which prices are assumed to be set such that supply and demand are equated via some costless auction-type frictionless mechanism that remains an undisclosed ‘black box’. Actual markets require actual rules and these rules affect the way in which prices are established, the way in which information possessed by traders is incorporated into asset prices, why some markets and stocks are liquid and why some markets are more fragile and costly than others.  
While this course is based on a relatively-new excellent text by three leading lights in the field, it is supplemented by a number of state-of-the-art studies that significantly advance our understanding of the role of different types of risk-volatility and illiquidity-in determining asset prices and the equity premium, for example, why it is that households can outperform professional investors?, how information contained in the stock price enables boards and CEOs to be monitored, and the role of counterparty transparency in improving market efficiency. Many of these papers are written by or with former students in the course.  
It first presents the basic modelling and tools used in the market microstructure field which analyses how prices are established in securities markets and whether or not markets are liquid. The course then analyses components of market design such as transparency and fragmentation (maker-taker fee structures and inverted markets, how investor heterogeneity leads to the (false?) rejection of asset pricing models, and how market design affects asset prices and corporate performance. 
This market microstructure course helps to address many of these fundamental issues, as well as equip students to read, understand and apply the rapidly developing market microstructure field in areas such as merchant banking. 
The goal of the course is to establish perspectives, approaches, tools and methods of independent thinking, analysis, and problem solving. Topics include exchange design rules, transparency and opacity, asymmetric information, private information, liquidity provision and pricing, volatility, transaction costs, strategic and noise trading, algorithmic trading, information and trading profits, dark pools, liquidity and returns. Three groups of traders are considered: domestic and foreign institutions and households. Households can be clients of either ‘full-service’ brokers or ‘discount’ brokers.

There is no doubt about the positive benefits of engaging in sports. The power of sports, however, goes well beyond the playing field, and individual benefit.  Sports traditionally are not appreciated for the vast extent of social good, and positive change  they can bring, in  both developing and developed countries.
This course will introduce students to the exciting new and emerging field of sport for development and social change (S4D/SC), where the power of sport goes well beyond the traditional playing fields to address health and social challenges. Through an inspiring mix of workshops, case studies, multi-media, field visits to see SD in action and guest experts, students will engage with the compelling power of this emerging field of sport for development and social change.

Popular (incorrect) answers include energy, heat, faeces and sweat. Surprisingly, this question has also baffled health professionals including general practitioners, dietitians and professional trainers. 
This course will lift the veil on weight loss by tracing every atom you eat into and out of your body, and you will learn the fate of fat during weight loss, that is, it is converted to carbon dioxide and water and exits your body mainly through your lungs. Along the way, you will also learn how humans convert foods into useful energy, what exactly is happening in your bodies during weight loss and weight gain, and by the end you will be able to critically examine popular weight loss claims as well as your own diet and lifestyle. Diet myths and wellness nonsense topple like dominoes along the way.

Specific areas of focus include: why some activities are criminalised and others not; the use and misuse of discretion; the impact of the reliance on summary justice; the significance of pre-trial processes such as search, arrest and bail; and the over-representation of Indigenous people and other vulnerable groups.

It examines the structures, rules and values that enable ethical practice for lawyers. The course explores ethical issues that arise in professional practice and the regulations and standards that govern them. It considers these issues and principles in light of our personal values, experiences and psychological biases, as well as wider and dynamic professional contexts. These contexts include the history and workings of the legal profession and its rapidly changing circumstances. They also include the diverse and demanding environments in which contemporary lawyers work.
This course treats questions of ethics as found in everyday decisions and behaviour, general as well as those particular to lawyers. However, Lawyers, Ethics & Justiceaddresses, in particular, the responsibilities of lawyers in maintaining the integrity of the justice system. In doing so, students will analyse the roles lawyers do and should play in the justice system, and relate them to the values and routine skills lawyers have, or should have, to ensure effective and just outcomes.
The course is also designed for students to evaluate the conduct of lawyers, the nature of ethical practice, and the pursuit of justice in light of their own identities, values and skills. Students are asked to consider what acting in accordance their values would mean for their own professional lives.
During the course, students will start to develop the skills they will need to engage in ethical legal practice, including those to: identify and address ethics issues; work with colleagues and other professionals to institute and maintain ethical work practices; recognise and manage the diverse needs and interests of clients; and integrate often competing duties to clients, the workplace, the profession, the judicial system and society.

The course exposes students to this material through an examination of Australia’s hybrid constitutional inheritance from the United Kingdom and United States, as adapted in the creation and subsequent development of the federal Commonwealth. In doing so it also examines the implications of colonisation for Indigenous legal systems and assertions of Crown sovereignty. The role, powers and interrelationship of the three arms of government are considered in contemporary as well as historical context, as are the issues of rights protection and constitutional change.

The bulk of the course is spent on the topics of contract and property law. In both cases, the course provides an introduction to materials that are expanded upon in later subjects. With respect to contract law, this course covers the formation of contracts and the doctrine of privity. Several other elements of contract law are dealt with later in the curriculum in Contracts. With respect to property law, this course considers the boundaries of the concept of property, as well as several of the rules with respect to the creation, transfer and protection of property rights. Again several other elements of property law are dealt with later in Land Law, and to some extent also in Equity and Trusts.

Common law reasoning and the elements of legal problem solving are introduced via a case study based on intentional torts, and the interpretation and application of statutes are developed throughout the course. The course emphasises the historical origins and dynamic nature of the Australian legal system as a settler colonial system, developing in the context of a changing Australian society. Through a consideration of the relationships between the principal institutions of government under Australian Constitutions – parliaments, the executive and the courts – it introduces students to key values and constructs underpinning the Australian legal system, including the significance, and limits, of conceptions of the ‘rule of law’. The course explores the nature of the common law and common law reasoning, with a particular emphasis on the circumstances of the adoption of the common law in the Australian states, the common law’s role in facilitating dispossession, and the ongoing impact of colonisation for Indigenous people in Australia. It also explores the processes by which cases are decided by judges, introducing some theoretical frameworks that have been used to analyse law and legal decision making. The roles of judges, practising lawyers and other personnel in the court system are also considered, with an emphasis on the need for the development of professional identities and resilience, as well as the role of lawyers in promoting just outcomes. Legal research methods and legal citation are taught via the Legal Research and Writing (Stage 1) tutorials attached to JURD7152.

Lawyers practice within established legal systems, with more or lesssettled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Citizens live, and the laws operate, in societies in which specificsocial arrangements, structures, roles, expectations and conceptions of what is possible and what is right, are widely heldand shape our views about law and about society. Customarily, most of us think within these categories andarrangements, rather than about them.
Theoretical investigation of those arrangements and understandings has to do with what underlies them. It isconcerned to look beneath what we take for granted, to see what accounts for it, what its nature is, how itworks and how it changes. Social theory is concerned to ask such questions about societies in which peoplelive. Investigations about theories of law and society will lead us beyond our original and usually quiteunreflectiveviews of what is important in law, what functions itplays, what it is for, whose interests it serves and how it serves them, what causes legal change and how important law is in society. In probing these questions we might come to confirm, modify or abandon our original assumptions; we will always, however, find these assumptions are more problematic, controversial and puzzling than they appeared at first to be.

This course is designed to introduce students to theoretical issues concerning the intricate and complex relationships between law and society. It seeks to do this by acquainting them with several important ways of approaching these issues, and with the sorts of questions best (and worst) addressed by each of these approaches.
 
The course materials are composed of two interlocking parts, each of which seeks to introduce students to a distinct range of questions—and a distinct way of asking such questions—about socio-legal relations.

Part 1—Law and Modernity: Classical Social Theory on Law in Modern Society
 
Classical social theory was born in nineteenth century Europe, that is, at a time and in a place which was undergoing massive and unprecedented social, economic, scientific and intellectual change. The early social theories differed markedly from each other, but they agreed upon one thing: the modern west was developing in ways and at a pace which were unprecedented in European history, and unparalleled anywhere else in this world. This so-called “great transformation” formed the context and topic of classical social theory. It prompted questions which had not been considered as urgently or directly before.
 
Among these are large questions about how people can and should be expected to behave, how increasingly large and complex societies “hang together”; and what differentiates one form of society and legal order from another. Typically the law presupposes that it has the answers to such questions. But in fact these questions have a form and structure that are not amenable to traditional legal analysis: a fact which renders lawyers, who are exercising their own specialised techniques, not especially expert in answering them. Listed immediately below are some of the questions that engaged the attention of the classic founders of modern social theory and which will be covered in the course.

1. What social functions do legal systems in general play, and what functions do specific types of legal systems play?
 
2. Is law necessary (or even beneficial) for orderly social life, or is it better to dispense with it?
 
3. What are the major influences on the nature of the law and legal systems and on change in them—economic, political or internal legal imperatives; the interests of classes or other “new social moveme",Pre-requisite: 24 UOC completed in LLB courses or 24 UOC completed in Juris Doctor courses.

JURD7223,"Term 1 2019, Term 2 2019, Term 3 2019","Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"This course encourages students to take a reflective interest in the study of law - its intellectual foundations, its socialconditions, its relationships with morality and politics, and its kinship with other disciplines, especially philosophy, ethicsand social theory. The course is theoretical in the following sense. In their practical, day-to-day, activities, lawyers take,and must take, much for granted: about the nature of the law, about the purposes and functions of its institutions anddoctrines, and about the worth of it all. They practise within established legal systems, with more or less settledinstitutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Customarily they think within the categories and arrangements provided bythe legal system, rather than about them.
Legal Theory is concerned to think about precisely those frameworks that lawyers think within. It aims to probe anddiscuss theoretical questions about law, which underlie the practical stuff of the law. Such questions include matters ofdescription and analysis - what's going on?; of comparison - what else goes on elsewhere and what can it tell us aboutwhat goes on here? - and of evaluation - is what is going on what should be going on? Purported answers to suchquestions are constantly assumed and relied upon in legal talk and action. Legal actors, however - like all social actors -are frequently unaware of the extent to which, or the ways in which, what they take to be perfectly obvious, natural andimpossible to imagine otherwise reflects particular, usually traditional assumptions which are questionable but are rarelyquestioned.
Legal theory examines such assumptions, clarifies the issues with which they are concerned and frequently shows theseissues to be more puzzling and contentious than is commonly assumed. It acquaints students with, and gives themopportunities to think about, question, criticise and defend, some of the most important ingredients in their own thoughtabout the law; ingredients which are all the more important for not being commonly recognised as matters of argument oreven discussion at all.
Theoretical inquiry has no predetermined 'results', or rather just one. Students will decide for themselves whether theyemerge from such inquiry with better or worse reasons to believe what they started with, or whether they should believenew or different things. On the other hand, however they begin, they are unlikely to emerge thinking that the questionsdiscussed in the course have simple, obvious or uncontroversial answers.
In general terms this course discusses the consequences for law of the present ascendancy of two basic ideas – legalpositivism as a dominant approach to understanding law and liberalism as an organising framework for thinking aboutpolitical life. Legalpositivism, basically, is the idea that the validity of law is a matter that can be worked out independentlyof non-legal (e.g. moral) concerns. A liberal understanding of politics among other things takes the conception of ourselvesas self-governing (as autonomous) as its basic value and evaluates legal practices in terms of how well or badly theycontribute to this value. Time is spent discussing these accounts of law and politics.
Along the way we discuss a number of basic ideas associated with contemporary legal/moral/political philosophy. Theseinclude - the nature of legal analysis, the separation of law from other areas of social life, the difference in moral theorybetween the right and the good, moral and personal autonomy, liberalism’s relationship to rights and to cultural andreligious difference, and law’s relationship to justice, democracy and the rule of law.
In order to make these ideas more concrete we relate them to certain ‘problems’ of contemporary legal practice.

The point of departure will be a consideration of the character of justice. Since this is an enduring philosophical question, posed differently at different times, it will be approached historically. We examine what some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present-day have understood about the nature of justice. The focus will be not only on explaining and critically analyzing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law.
Not only will the course analyse different theories of justice, but it will also put the ideas, gained through such analysis, to work by considering a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, what are the criteria of justice and how in modern circumstances might we ground these? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice? Is any interpretation of law always based on an understanding of legal justice? And what are we to make of various claims to justice, for instance, international justice, intergenerational justice, historical or transitional justice?

It covers topics of concern toindividuals as well as business and government, including protection of intellectual property in a digital environment,electronic contracts, computer and information security, and cyber crime.
The interaction between traditional law and modern technology plays a central role in the course. In order to analyse theimpact and application of traditional legal principles in a new technological environment, the principles must be translatedinto the language of the technologies involved. The translation must preserve the original meaning and policy rationale. Itis the aim of the course to teach, encourage and nurture such thinking. Examples of problems we shall encounter andanalyze in the course include the connection between enabling technologies of cyber crime and the contours of liability ofcyber criminals and their enablers; how an understanding of the Internet informs whether notice of electronic contractualterms is properly provided by a hyperlink; and determining whether an implied term of fitness for purpose can be read intoa contract to download software.
A statement by Professor Lawrence Lessig captures the essence of the course: “[w]hen dealing with cyberspace, judgesare to be translators; different technologies are the different languages; and the aim is to find a reading of [legal principles]that preserves [their] meaning from one world’s technology to another. This is fidelity as translation.”[1] Lawyers who failto understand the translation will likely pursue sub-optimal litigation strategies, face speculative recovery prospects, andmay overlook effective and potentially powerful defences.

The point of departure will be a consideration of the character of justice. Since this is an enduring philosophical question, posed differently at different times, it will be approached historically. We examine what some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present-day have understood about the nature of justice. The focus will be not only on explaining and critically analyzing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law.
Not only will the course analyse different theories of justice, but it will also put the ideas, gained through such analysis, to work by considering a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, what are the criteria of justice and how in modern circumstances might we ground these? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice? Is any interpretation of law always based on an understanding of legal justice? And what are we to make of various claims to justice, for instance, international justice, intergenerational justice, historical or transitional justice?

The first part of the course focuses on the 1951 Refugee Convention, including who qualifies for refugee status, the protections afforded to refugees and the procedures for refugee status determination. The second part of the course considers the capacity of the current international legal framework to respond to displaced persons who do not fall within the Refugee Convention, such as internallydisplaced persons, persons fleeing human rights abuses or civil war, and those whose movement is a result of climate change or environmental catastrophe. The course considers the theoretical underpinnings of the international forced migration regime and queries why States have agreed to protect certain categories of persons and not others, and whether this is legally and/or ethically sound.
This course considers the legal obligations of States and international organisations to assist and protect forced migrants. While the focus of the course is on international law responses to issues of forced migration, consideration will also be given to the relationship between the international legal regime and domestic law. In particular, this course will provide an opportunity to discuss current issues in forced migration regulation in Australia.

JURD7404,Term 3 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"Over the past ten years the concept of children’s rights has received a greater amount of attention in legal discourse. Internationally, investigations into child labour, child sexual exploitation and child abductions appear to be increasing at an exponential rate. In many nations of the Western world, reports of prostituted juveniles, young offenders accused of violent crimes and harms related to the new technologies have impacted on communities. In the South and in many countries in transition, the incidents of child soldiers, child sex tourism and trafficking of young people seem continuously to be highlighted in the media. Jurisprudence developing from the decisions of domestic courts, administrative tribunals and withininternational fora has provided insights into policy issues while at the same time offering contradictory messages on the legal responsibility and status of children. Because of this, there is a need to better understand the current status of the law and what your role may be – as lawyers, advocates or simply as concerned members of civil society – in ensuring that the rights of all citizens are respected, regardless of their age. It has been said that the phrase ""children’s rights"" is a slogan in search of a definition. This course will attempt to find its meaning by surveying the history and legal development of children’s rightsinternationally, while offering a pragmatic approach to its application.

JURD7431,"Term 1 2019, Term 2 2019, Term 3 2019","Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"This course encourages students to take a reflective interest in the study of law - its intellectual foundations, its social conditions, its relationships with morality and politics, and its kinship with other disciplines, especially philosophy, ethics and social theory. The course is theoretical in the following sense.  In their practical, day-to-day, activities, lawyers take, and must take, much for granted: about the nature of the law, about the purposes and functions of its institutions and doctrines, and about the worth of it all.  They practise within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules.  Customarily they think within the categories and arrangements provided by the legal system, rather than about them. 
 
Legal Theory is concerned to think about precisely those frameworks that lawyers think within.  It aims to probe and discuss theoretical questions about law, which underlie the practical stuff of the law.  Such questions include matters of description and analysis - what's going on?; of comparison - what else goes on elsewhere and what can it tell us about what goes on here? - and of evaluation - is what is going on what should be going on? Purported answers to such questions are constantly assumed and relied upon in legal talk and action. Legal actors, however - like all social actors - are frequently unaware of the extent to which, or the ways in which, what they take to be perfectly obvious, natural and impossible to imagine otherwise reflects particular, usually traditional assumptions which are questionable but are rarely questioned.

Legal theory examines such assumptions, clarifies the issues with which they are concerned and frequently shows these issues to be more puzzling and contentious than is commonly assumed.  It acquaints students with, and gives them opportunities to think about, question, criticise and defend, some of the most important ingredients in their own thought about the law; ingredients which are all the more important for not being commonly recognised as matters of argument or even discussion at all. 
 
Theoretical inquiry has no predetermined 'results', or rather just one. Students will decide for themselves whether they emerge from such inquiry with better or worse reasons to believe what they started with, or whether they should believe new or different things. On the other hand, however they begin, they are unlikely to emerge thinking that the questions discussed in the course have simple, obvious or uncontroversial answers.

In general terms this course discusses the consequences for law of the present ascendancy of two basic ideas – legal positivism as a dominant approach to understanding law and liberalism as an organising framework for thinking about political life. Legalpositivism, basically, is the idea that the validity of law is a matter that can be worked out independently of non-legal (e.g. moral) concerns. A liberal understanding of politics among other things takes the conception of ourselves as self-governing (as autonomous) as its basic value and evaluates legal practices in terms of how well or badly they contribute to this value. Time is spent discussing these accounts of law and politics.
 
Along the way we discuss a number of basic ideas associated with contemporary legal/moral/political philosophy. These include - the nature of legal analysis, the separation of law from other areas of social life, the difference in moral theory between the right and the good, moral and personal autonomy, liberalism’s relationship to rights and to cultural and religious difference, and law’s relationship to justice, democracy and the rule of law.

JURD7449,Summer Term 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"This unit explores the emerging complexity of the relation between Law and Biology in the 21th century. It examines the following question: What does the concept ""biology"" do in legal descriptions of events in the world. Law not just regulates, allows, or limits what can be done or undone biologically but it also defines or alters our philosophical, political or social self-understanding. Both law and biology are meaningful structures which define, diagnose, and create concepts of persons as ""nature"", ""bodies"", ""organism"", ""groups"" or ""life"" (to name just a few). ""Law and Biology"" aims to provide a historical, analytical, and critical reflection on the legal implications of biological or biologized legalities.
The unit complements other units offered at the law school such as Legal Theory, Law and Social Theory, and Theories of Law and Justice. Similar to these units, Law and Biology has an emphasis on theoretical and critical aspects of the topic and relates law to an interdisciplinary field of knowledge and legal practices. The unit also relates to units such as Law and Medical Health or Intellectual Property Law which connect law with the biomedical or biotechnological field. The main difference with the theory electives is that Law and Biology takes place in an entirely different context, the field of biology, and that its focus is on theorizing law in the contemporary world where biolegitimacy increasingly takes hold. The difference with the other units is that the Law and Biology unit does not focus on matters of litigation. Instead, it opens up a broader and theoretical horizon both in the ways law itself can be understood and how it is connected to biology and science as a method. This connection will be explained through historical, analytical and legal insights and will include reflections on the scientific and ethical questions this relation provokes in the contemporary legal system. 
Students wishing to think about law “outside the box"" and who are interested in developing a rich theoretical and interdisciplinary perspective on law combining insights from philosophy, biology, technology, sociology, neurology, psychology and ethics will surely enjoy this course.It is recommended that students have some knowledge in legal theory through having taken one of the legal theory prescribed electives before enrolling in this course. No pre-existing knowledge of biology is necessary.

Control over the entry, stay and rights of non-citizens is a defining feature of State sovereignty and allows a State to determine the boundaries of the membership of its political community. 
The course adopts a thematic and theoretical approach to examining the legal regulation internationally and by States of the entry and stay of migrants and the status and rights conferred on citizens and non-citizens. It begins with an analysis of the theoretical approaches to global movements of people, including the relationship between the international legal context, State sovereignty, border control and citizenship and individual rights. It then examines the power of the State to refuse entry to, detain and exclude migrants from its territory and to grant, deny or withdraw citizenship status as embodied in the policies and domestic laws of the State and the international legal context in which the movement of people takes place.
The course examines the legal frameworks adopted by States for managing migrant populations and the recognition of citizenship status from a variety of perspectives: theoretical and practical, historical and contemporary, comparative, constitutional, statutory and regulatory.

JURD7554,Term 2 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"Trade remedies are the most popular area in international trade law practice and the most adjudicated at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). They are actions taken by governments to counteract “dumping” through antidumping measures, subsidies through countervailing measures, and unexpected increases in the volume of imports through safeguard measures, for the protection of domestic industries. A typical form of these measures is an imposition of additional import duties on the top of the standard ones. WTO members are free to resort to trade remedies but must follow the relevant WTO rules.
This course offers a comprehensive and detailed study of the laws and practice of trade remedies. It studies the rationale for trade remedies; the domestic law and practice in selected countries with a focus on Australia (as an active user of trade remedies) and China (as a major target of trade remedies worldwide); the relevant WTO rules and major dispute settlement cases; negotiations of reforms of WTO rules on trade remedies; and the regulation of trade remedies under free trade agreements (FTAs). The course offers abundant opportunities for students to gain legal expertise and practical experience through case studies, simulation, and face-to-face discussion with leading trade and commercial lawyers.

JURD7596,Term 3 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"This course will teach students how to design legal information systems, integrating expert systems, hypertext, text retrieval and other technologies, for use in generating legal documents from precedents and assisting users to navigate solutions to legal problems. After learning the necessary skills, students will work in small groups, in partnership with a not-for-profit centre or organisation, to design and build a legal information system.
In class, students will also be exposed to a variety of examples of automation of legal tasks, and the various legal and practical issues associated with their use, including issues of professional regulation. This will include guest lectures from those working on legal expert systems and related technologies. Students will also become familiar with theoretical approaches to legal information systems development, and the range of technologies and approaches that may contribute to applications development.
Designing legal information systems requires students to think through a class of legal problems in a structured way. Systems can be used to generate legal documents from precedents, with variations based on the responses of a user, as well as to answer legal questions within a particular field. They are one component of the increasing tendency to automate legal tasks. Used well, legal information systems can facilitate access to legal information and expertise, but always within the limits of their designer's foresight. Designing a good legal information system thus requires skills in legal analysis and problem-solving, as well as the ability to think creatively and explore different approaches to a problem.
This course does not require students to have any pre-existing skills or experience in expert systems or computer programming - the course itself includes instruction on how to use expert system software.

The lecturers do not assume students have had any previous exposure to competition law in any of these jurisdictions or to the study of economics. The course looks at the meaning of competition; the rights and obligations of actual or would be competitors; the role that competition law is generally expected to play in society and the nature of markets and marketing power. All these issues are examined in a global context since businesses of all sizes are increasingly operating across borders and may be forced to modify their conduct and tailor their marketing and distribution systems to fit quite different competition regimes.

Intellectual property is an important area of commercial legal practice and is vital to many industries. This course introduces students to the statutory provisions and common law relating to Australian intellectual property. For each topic, the course gives consideration to the subject matter that is protected, the preconditions for protection, and the nature of infringement. Other matters (such as remedies, competition law and international protection) may be dealt with briefly but are not examined in detail.
As far as possible in an intensive overview, this course focuses on the commercial and business aspects of intellectual property. By the end of the course, students should be able to identify copyright, trademark and passing off, designs and patent law issues, and make an informed decision about how to proceed in advising a client.

Lawyers practice within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Citizens live, and the laws operate, in societies in which specific social arrangements, structures, roles, expectations and conceptions of what is possible and what is right, are widely held and shape our views about law and about society. Customarily, most of us think within these categories and arrangements, rather than about them.
Theoretical investigation of those arrangements and understandings has to do with what underlies them. It is concerned to look beneath what we take for granted, to see what accounts for it, what its nature is, how it works and how it changes. Social theory is concerned to ask such questions about societies in which people live. Investigations about theories of law and society will lead us beyond our original and usually quite unreflectiveviews of what is important in law, what functions itplays, what it is for, whose interests it serves and how it serves them, what causes legal change and how important law is in society. In probing these questions we might come to confirm, modify or abandon our original assumptions; we will always, however, find these assumptions are more problematic, controversial and puzzling than they appeared at first to be.
 
This course is designed to introduce students to theoretical issues concerning the intricate and complex relationships between law and society. It seeks to do this by acquainting them with several important ways of approaching these issues, and with the sorts of questions best (and worst) addressed by each of these approaches.

The course materials are composed of two interlocking parts, each of which seeks to introduce students to a distinct range of questions—and a distinct way of asking such questions—about socio-legal relations.
 
Part 1—Law and Modernity: Classical Social Theory on Law in Modern Society
 
Classical social theory was born in nineteenth century Europe, that is, at a time and in a place which was undergoing massive and unprecedented social, economic, scientific and intellectual change. The early social theories differed markedly from each other, but they agreed upon one thing: the modern west was developing in ways and at a pace which were unprecedented in European history, and unparalleled anywhere else in this world. This so-called “great transformation” formed the context and topic of classical social theory. It prompted questions which had not been considered as urgently or directly before.

Among these are large questions about how people can and should be expected to behave, how increasingly large and complex societies “hang together”; and what differentiates one form of society and legal order from another. Typically the law presupposes that it has the answers to such questions. But in fact these questions have a form and structure that are not amenable to traditional legal analysis: a fact which renders lawyers, who are exercising their own specialised techniques, not especially expert in answering them. Listed immediately below are some of the questions that engaged the attention of the classic founders of modern social theory and which will be covered in the course.
 
 
 
 

1. What social functions do legal systems in general play, and what functions do specific types of legal systems play?
 
2. Is law necessary (or even beneficial) for orderly social life, or is it better to dispense with it?

JURD7633,Term 3 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"The Criminal Trial is a course that grounds the study of the criminal trial by contextualising the impact of the law of evidence and advocacy practice while building on students' basic knowledge of the doctrine, principles and rules relating to criminal litigation. It builds on and extends students' studies in criminal law, criminal procedure, the law of evidence, legal profession and various clinical and experiental law courses, including Kingsford Legal Centre. It does this by providing a multidisciplinary framework that explicates the role of participants in the criminal trial process. Classroom discussion focuses on commentaries examining a variety of issues associated with the dynamics of criminal trials. These issues vary from year to year, allowing for topical themes to be developed but they include comparative analysis, human rights principles and various multidisciplinary  perspectives including, the observations of historians, psychologists, sociologists, architects and linguists. A practice-orientation is an important component of the course as it assists to develop the rhetoric/reality theme that guides the course. It is fulfilled through guest speakers such as barristers and trial judges and through students fieldwork obligations.  Outside classroom hours students must attend and observe criminal trials in progress. This observation requirement is built into the final assessment, which is an essay based comparing the conduct and practices of participants in observed trials with what the law expects, requires or assumes exists in relation to those participants.
Outside classroom hours students must attend and observe criminal trials in progress. This enables students to not onlylearn about trial practice first hand but, with classroom discussion and the readings, better appreciate its relationship todoctrinal theory. The observation requirement is also built into the final assessment, which is an essay-based analysiswith a choice between two topics. One topic asks students to compare the conduct and practices of participants inobserved trials withwhat the law expects, requires or assumes. The other (alternate) topic requires students to explore a miscarriage of justicescenario of their own choice.

China opened up its economy to market forces only in the late 1970s. When it did so, law and the legal system lost the pariah status they had been given during the Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The course examines the role law plays in modern China by reference to its historical antecedents. It looks at particular areas of development, not only for their own sake, but also as indicators of the changing role of law in Chinese society. Areas that are the subject of particular attention include: elements and institutions of the Chinese legal system; the role of law in Chinese society from the perspectives of legal history and philosophy; contract law; intellectual property law; foreign investment law; corporate and securities law; foreign trade law; and mediation, arbitration and civil enforcement procedures.
In addition to classroom teaching, there will be field trips to Chinese legal institutions, such as a Chinese court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, an arbitration commission, and/or a Chinese law firm.

This course introduces students to fundamental aspects of criminal justice and process. Woven through the course is a critical examination of the interaction between the criminal justice system and the criminal law: specifically, that application of the law is shaped by and dependent on decisions made by criminal justice actors including police, prosecutors and judicial officers. Specific areas of focus include: why some activities are criminalised and others not; the use and misuse of discretion; the impact of the reliance on summary justice; the significance of pre-trial processes such as search, arrest and bail; and the over-representation of Indigenous people and other vulnerable groups.

Crime and the Criminal Process also introduces the doctrinal building blocks of criminal law, and applies these principles to a number of key statutory offences such as public order offences and drugs offences which illustrate the process themes above. The impact of public policy and law reform is an important underlying theme.

This course follows from LAWS1021 / JURD 7121 Crime and the Criminal Process, and applies the perspectives and themes of that course to the doctrinally central criminal offences and defences. These are examined in a contextual framework that emphasises the policy and social issues underpinning the development and application of the law. This critical approach allows students to appreciate a complex set of conflicting ideologies, principles, discretion and histories informing the criminal law. The course draws on materials from other disciplines – especially criminology, history, sociology and feminist theory, which enhance students’ appreciation of the law in context. Social issues including race, class and gender are stressed. Comparisons with jurisdictions other than NSW are undertaken where this highlights relevant policy issues, legislative alternatives, or demonstrates the contingent nature of the law in question. Throughout, detailed doctrinal analysis of the chosen offences/defences takes place and students develop the skills of legal element analysis of both statutory and common law offences and defences.

CFLS develops students’ understanding of the functioning of the legal system and facility with foundational legal skills that students acquired in LAWS1121 – Legal System and Skills A. Students are introduced to fundamental concepts and legal paradigms in three core areas of substantive law: contract; tort and criminal law. The course focuses on students’ acquisition of legal problem-solving skills in both oral and written contexts to enhance students’ understanding of legal principles found in case and statute law in these three fields. It provides preparation for, and an introduction to, the study of Contract, Tort and Criminal Law in the LLB program.
 
Module 1: Contract
A good grounding in the basic principles of contract law is a fundamental element of any legal education. This Module is an introduction to the study of voluntarily assumed legal obligations which govern many important areas of daily life. This Module focuses on students acquiring a sound understanding of a number of basic principles of contract law, through common law method, with particular focus on the elements required for the formation of a valid contract, namely offer and acceptance; consideration; intention to create legal relations; certainty and privity.
 
Module 2: Criminal Justice
The aims of the Criminal Justice module are to introduce students to foundational elements of the criminal law, and some key issues related to criminal justice. The course will include an examination of the components of criminal offences generally, and will take two substantive offences (murder and offensive language/behaviour) to see how these elements play out in practice.
 
Module 3: Tort
This module covers the part of the law of torts which signifies, broadly speaking, the law determining liability to pay compensation for wrongfully caused injury, damage or loss through medical negligence.
The prime objective is to introduce students to the core principles of negligence, including a critical understanding of the policy considerations informing the law. A second objective of this course is to examine a relatively limited number of leading cases and legislation in selected areas and thereby develop skills of analysis, synthesis and evaluation. A third objective is to encourage students to consider the way in which the law of torts operates in the context of society as a whole, and the ways in which it is influenced by such particular factors as insurance, social security, and the need (or absence of a need) to ascribe fault. Thus there is a theoretical component to the course which introduces various debates about the nature and effectiveness of tort law.","Prerequisite: Academic program must be 7016, Humanities Pathway Program.",6 Units of Credit
LAWS1124,Term 2 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"The KLC component of Lawyers and Society fits with your other law courses in that it demonstrates law in practice and the specific ways in which it impacts on disadvantaged clients. Law is a subjective, constantly changing area and this course will give you the opportunity to explore some of the ways in which law is used in the legal aid system to assist people who are disadvantaged.
The Legal Ethics component of Lawyers and Society complements the KLC component of Lawyers and Society by providing some theoretical background to many of the ethical issues you could encounter as a practising lawyer. It also provides an introduction to the Bachelor of Laws core course LAWS1230 – Lawyers, Ethics and Justice.

This course introduces students to the study of public law, including its history, institutions, methods of reasoning and fundamental principles. Students will acquire an understanding of the introductory principles and theories of administrative and constitutional law as they apply to the essential features of the Australian system of government, and their implications for human rights and the rule of law. The course exposes students to this material through an examination of Australia’s hybrid constitutional inheritance from the United Kingdom and United States, as adapted in the creation and subsequent development of the federal Commonwealth. In doing so it also examines the implications of colonisation for Indigenous legal systems and assertions of Crown sovereignty. The role, powers and interrelationship of the three arms of government are considered in contemporary as well as historical context, as are the issues of rights protection and constitutional change. The course prepares students for their later study of the courses LAWS1160: Administrative Law and LAWS2150: Federal Constitutional Law, and also introduces students to the fundamentals of the skill of statutory interpretation in the public law context.

This course introduces students to the basic elements and principles of private law. It begins by looking at what the term private law means, the sources of private law and how the different areas of private law - especially property, contract, tort and unjust enrichment – relate to each other.
The bulk of the course is spent on the topics of contract and property law. In both cases, the course provides an introduction to materials that are expanded upon in later subjects. With respect to contract law, this course covers the formation of contracts and the doctrine of privity. Several other elements of contract law are dealt with later in the curriculum in Contracts. With respect to property law, this course considers the boundaries of the concept of property, as well as several of the rules with respect to the creation, transfer and protection of property rights. Again several other elements of property law are dealt with later in Land Law, and to some extent also in Equity and Trusts.
The course also introduces students to two smaller topics: agency and equitable estoppel. As well as being closely related to contracts and property, these are two important areas of law for practicing lawyers.

LAWS1230,"Term 1 2019, Term 2 2019, Term 3 2019","Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"Lawyers, Ethics & Justice is a compulsory core course in applied legal ethics. It examines the structures, rules and values that enable ethical practice for lawyers. The course explores ethical issues that arise in professional practice and the regulations and standards that govern them. It considers these issues and principles in light of our personal values, experiences and psychological biases, as well as wider and dynamic professional contexts. These contexts include the history and workings of the legal profession and its rapidly changing circumstances. They also include the diverse and demanding environments in which contemporary lawyers work. 
This course treats questions of ethics as found in everyday decisions and behaviour, general as well as those particular to lawyers. However, Lawyers, Ethics & Justice addresses, in particular, the responsibilities of lawyers in maintaining the integrity of the justice system. In doing so, students will analyse the roles lawyers do and should play in the justice system, and relate them to the values and routine skills lawyers have, or should have, to ensure effective and just outcomes. 
The course is also designed for students to evaluate the conduct of lawyers, the nature of ethical practice, and the pursuit of justice in light of their own identities, values and skills. Students are asked to consider what acting in accordance their values would mean for their own professional lives. 
During the course, students will start to develop the skills they will need to engage in ethical legal practice, including those to: identify and address ethics issues; work with colleagues and other professionals to institute and maintain ethical work practices; recognise and manage the diverse needs and interests of clients; and integrate often competing duties to clients, the workplace, the profession, the judicial system and society. This course combines interactive teaching, group work, and a clinical component in which students work with clients and lawyers at UNSW Law's Kingsford Legal Centre.

This course continues students’ exposure to the field of public law, to which they have been earlier introduced in LAWS1141: Principles of Public Law. In LAWS2150 students engage with the intellectual debates surrounding methods of constitutional interpretation, before embarking on a study of the scope of specific Commonwealth legislative powers of importance in the contemporary operation of Australia’s federal system. The course also examines the effect of express and implied constitutional limitations upon the powers of government – particularly those which protect civil and political rights. Understanding of the scope of valid legislative action is developed through application of propositions of constitutional law to actual and hypothetical legislative instruments.

Law in the Global Context is a core course that responds to the changing nature of law in Australia and around the world - namely the increasing interdependence of legal systems and the infusion of international law into Australian law and institutions.  The course introduces students to various areas of law having an international dimension, in particular public international law, private international law, comparative law and transnational law. It will concentrate on key themes and emerging trends in these areas through case studies and in depth consideration of the law in action. It will also specifically introduce students to the interaction of 'global law' with the different branches of Australian law studied in other compulsory courses.  The course will instil in students an appreciation of the essential notions that underpin international, transnational and comparative law, such as sovereignty, private international law, and transplantation of law.  Students will additionally undergo a series of tutorials on researching and writing about law in a global context.",Prerequisite:Completion of 78 UOC in LAWS courses including Equity and Trusts (LAWS2385).

LAWS2320,"Term 1 2019, Term 2 2019, Term 3 2019","Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"This course encourages students to take a reflective interest in the study of law - its intellectual foundations, its social conditions, its relationships with morality and politics, and its kinship with other disciplines, especially philosophy, ethics and social theory. The course is theoretical in the following sense.  In their practical, day-to-day, activities, lawyers take, and must take, much for granted: about the nature of the law, about the purposes and functions of its institutions and doctrines, and about the worth of it all.  They practise within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules.  Customarily they think within the categories and arrangements provided by the legal system, rather than about them. 
 
Legal Theory is concerned to think about precisely those frameworks that lawyers think within.  It aims to probe and discuss theoretical questions about law, which underlie the practical stuff of the law.  Such questions include matters of description and analysis - what's going on?; of comparison - what else goes on elsewhere and what can it tell us about what goes on here? - and of evaluation - is what is going on what should be going on? Purported answers to such questions are constantly assumed and relied upon in legal talk and action. Legal actors, however - like all social actors - are frequently unaware of the extent to which, or the ways in which, what they take to be perfectly obvious, natural and impossible to imagine otherwise reflects particular, usually traditional assumptions which are questionable but are rarely questioned.
 
Legal theory examines such assumptions, clarifies the issues with which they are concerned and frequently shows these issues to be more puzzling and contentious than is commonly assumed.  It acquaints students with, and gives them opportunities to think about, question, criticise and defend, some of the most important ingredients in their own thought about the law; ingredients which are all the more important for not being commonly recognised as matters of argument or even discussion at all. 

Theoretical inquiry has no predetermined 'results', or rather just one. Students will decide for themselves whether they emerge from such inquiry with better or worse reasons to believe what they started with, or whether they should believe new or different things. On the other hand, however they begin, they are unlikely to emerge thinking that the questions discussed in the course have simple, obvious or uncontroversial answers.
 
In general terms this course discusses the consequences for law of the present ascendancy of two basic ideas – legal positivism as a dominant approach to understanding law and liberalism as an organising framework for thinking about political life. Legalpositivism, basically, is the idea that the validity of law is a matter that can be worked out independently of non-legal (e.g. moral) concerns. A liberal understanding of politics among other things takes the conception of ourselves as self-governing (as autonomous) as its basic value and evaluates legal practices in terms of how well or badly they contribute to this value. Time is spent discussing these accounts of law and politics.

Along the way we discuss a number of basic ideas associated with contemporary legal/moral/political philosophy. These include - the nature of legal analysis, the separation of law from other areas of social life, the difference in moral theory between the right and the good, moral and personal autonomy, liberalism’s relationship to rights and to cultural and religious difference, and law’s relationship to justice, democracy and the rule of law.
 
In order to make these ideas more concrete we relate them to certain ‘problems’ of contemporary legal practice.",Pre-requisite: 24 UOC completed in LLB courses or 24 UOC completed in Juris Doctor courses. Juris Doctor students who commenced prior to 2013 need no pre-requisites.,6 Units of Credit
LAWS2326,"Term 1 2019, Term 3 2019","Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"This course seeks to understand the nature of law and justice and, in particular, the relationship between the two, in contemporary society. The point of departure will be a consideration of the character of justice. Since this is an enduring philosophical question, posed differently at different times, it will be approached historically. We examine what some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present-day have understood about the nature of justice. The focus will be not only on explaining and critically analyzing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law.
Not only will the course analyse different theories of justice, but it will also put the ideas, gained through such analysis, to work by considering a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, what are the criteria of justice and how in modern circumstances might we ground these? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice? Is any interpretation of law always based on an understanding of legal justice? And what are we to make of various claims to justice, for instance, international justice, intergenerational justice, historical or transitional justice?

Court Process, Evidence and Proof provides students with an analytical study of the law of evidence and civil and criminal court processes. These topics are examined in their legal, ethical and socio-psychological dimensions. The course approaches these topics by first exploring the legal and factual elements that define evidence law. In the criminal context, the course additionally explores prosecutors’ ethical and legal obligations to the court and to the defendant. From this preliminary framework students examine key principles, rules and institutional elements associated with the formal adjudication of legal disputes. Australia’s uniform evidence legislation provides the major doctrinal focus of this course. Its institutional focus centres on the role of participants in the court process. The course aims to foster in students critical analytical skills and values consistent with aspirational ideals of professional and ethical legal practice. These goals are pursued by observational fieldwork, audiovisual aids, occasional guest speakers, readings and the engagement of students in classroom discussion that is aimed at developing their understanding of the complexities and challenges evidence law and court processes create for litigants, lawyers, witnesses and decisionmakers. In addition, the course pays particular attention to ensuring students fully appreciate the important rights of criminal defendants and the protections afforded to them in court.

The resolution of civil disputes requires legal practitioners to be equally competent in invoking the court system or employing negotiation, mediation or arbitration. The course addresses civil procedure which governs the steps involved in initiating, conducting, managing, terminating, enforcing or appealing the outcome of, legal proceedings in a Court. Specific attention is paid to jurisdiction, case management, pleadings, discovery and costs. The course provides an introduction to Alternative Dispute Resolution, in particular, negotiation, mediation and arbitration. The course examines the advantages and disadvantages of each dispute resolution procedure and the factors that influence when they should be utilised from both policy and practice perspectives. The course also explores principles of adversarial litigation that inform the rules, both in content and in practice, and ethical issues that the resolution of disputes creates for lawyers.

This course introduces students to the doctrines of equity and the law of trusts. It traces the historical development of equity and its relationship with common law. Students will critically consider the appropriate application of a range of equitable doctrines to particular scenarios and the availability of different remedies. Students will also be introduced to the law of trusts and, in particular, the nature of a trust, legal requirements in establishing a trust as well as the rights, duties and powers associated with trusts. The course assumes familiarity with equitable doctrines taught in Principles of Private Law and Contracts (alternatively Contracts 1 and 2), for instance estoppel, undue influence, unconscionability. For students who have not completed Principles of Private Law, the course will include a transitional module on personal property to introduce subject matter that was previously taught in Property, Equity and Trusts and will in future be taught in Principles of Private Law. This is an important pre-requisite for learning about trusts, which involve property.

It does not substantially overlap with specialised commercial options such as Law of Banking, Commercial Finance, Consumer Protection Law, Economic Analysis of Law, Insurance Law, Insolvency Law, International Trade Law, Interests in Securities, Regulation of Economic Activity, and Securities and Financial Services Regulation. As a 6 unit elective, Commercial Law introduces students to the way in which general principles of common law, equity and statute law have developed to deal with the needs of commercial markets by focussing on:
The law applicable to commercial sales of goods; andAgency law
The course, like the players in commercial markets, takes a problem-solving approach to subject matter, but also considers the broader policy dimensions of commercial law doctrines and practices. The problem solving approach investigates the way traders structure transactions to take best advantage of the protection offered by existing legal doctrines, and so illuminates the creative ways in which legal models or concepts are adapted to achieve pragmatic goals.

LAWS3046,"Term 1 2019, Term 2 2019","Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"This course, together with Intellectual Property 2: Trade Marks and Patents, collectively consider Australian intellectual property (IP) law.
IP—which encompasses the laws of copyright, designs, patents, breach of confidence, passing off and registered trade marks, as well as various related doctrines—has become one of the most important areas of commercial legal practice in recent years. It is vital to the marketing, advertising, entertainment, communications and science and technology industries. The two courses together aim to introduce students to each of the general law and statutory protections outlined above. For each of the heads of protection, the courses gives detailed consideration to the subject matter which is protected, the pre-conditions for protection, and the nature of infringement. Various justifications for IP are also considered, particularly in the context of new or developing forms of IP.
Intellectual Property 1: Copyright and Designs considers two key aspects of Australian IP law. The first, which is the focus of the course, is the law of copyright. Copyright primarily protects creative and entrepreneurial subject matter such as books, art, music, films and TV broadcasts. The course focuses on key issues such as the history of and justifications for copyright; copyright subject matter; requirements for subsistence; ownership and exploitation; infringement, defences and remedies; and moral rights. Attention will also be paid to emerging debates, policy issues and law reform proposals on such issues as the impact of digital technology, rights in entertainment franchises and indigenous artists’ rights. The second aspect of IP law considered in the course is registered designs, with a focus on requirements for registration, infringement, and the techniques used to manage the overlap between copyright and design protection.
Intellectual  Property 1 and Intellectual Property 2 can be taken in any order.
Please be aware that students who take Intellectual Property 1 and/or Intellectual Property 2 will not be able to take LAWS3021 Foundations of Intellectual Property Law and/or LAWS3057 Advanced Intellectual Property Policy and Practice.

This course will examine theses two state bills of rights, and their likely future interpretation in light of both existing case-law and comparative experience in jurisdictions such as the US, Canada, South Africa nad the UK. The course will also explore the broader theoretic  stakes behind these interpretive questions, ongoing debates about the potential amendment of these charters (so as, for example, to include more extensive socioeconomic rights protections) and the adoption of a rights charter at a national level.

Policy: The course provides opportunities to explore some contentious areas of debate and policy development within intellectual property law, such as trade mark counterfeiting and copyright piracy; issues surrounding bio-prospecting and ownership of genetic material; protection of indigenous cultural and intellectual property (‘ICIP’); and the effects of intellectual property laws on access to essential medicines.
Practice: The course also examines practical issues intellectual property lawyers are likely to confront in practice, such as franchising; the interplay of marketing, branding and trade marks; portfolio management; criminal offences; registration practice and strategies; parallel importation; geographical indications. A choice of assessment options allows students to either extend their knowledge in a particular area of interest through a research essay, or develop their practical legal skills by advising hypothetical clients in a series of short problem question exercises known as ‘practice briefs’.

LAWS3070,Term 2 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"Investment treaties are among the most powerful and controversial instruments of international economic governance. They grant foreign investors broad protections from interference by the governments of the countries in which they invest. They also establish an international mechanism for adjudication and enforcement, allowing foreign investors to bypass national courts and, instead, bring cases against states directly to international arbitration. The amount at stake in these disputes regularly runs into billions of dollars. Philip Morris’ recent case against Australia arising from Australia’s tobacco plain packaging legislation is a high profile example. Supporters argue that investment treaties promote foreign investment and respect for the rule of law in countries that are bound by them. Critics argue that investment treaties constitute a ‘bill of rights for multinational corporations’ that is enforced through ‘secret courts’. 
This course provides an introduction to the law and policy of the investment treaty regime. The course covers the network of almost 3000 bilateral investment treaties, along with the investment chapters of multi-issue free trade agreements, such as NAFTA and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. It also covers international dispute settlement through investment treaty arbitration under the ICSID and UNCITRAL Rules. Topics covered include:
-          The range of foreign investors and foreign investments covered by investment treaties;
-          Key substantive protections contained in investment treaties, such as guarantees of ‘fair and equitable treatment’, non-discriminatory treatment and compensation for expropriation;
-          Rules and procedures governing investment treaty arbitration;
-          International enforcement of arbitral awards.
All topics are illustrated with practical examples drawn from the 700 known investment treaty arbitrations conducted to date.
The course also encourages students to engage with the central policy debates relating to the investment treaty regime, including:
-          whether governments fully understood the implications of investment treaties when they signed them;
-          whether investment treaties deliver economic benefits promised by their proponents;
-          how the goal of protecting foreign investment should be balanced with governments’ need to regulate in the public interest;
-          how investment treaties relate to other regimes of investment governance, such as investor-state contracts, national law and investment insurance.
The course is relevant to:
-          students considering a career in international dispute settlement, whether in private practice or as a government lawyer;
-          students seeking to understand the interaction between national and international legal regimes governing international economic activity;

Areas which are the subject of particular attention include: the elements and institutions of Chinese legal system; the role of law in Chinese society from the perspectives of legal history and philosophy; contract law; intellectual property law; foreign investment law; corporate and securities law; foreign trade law and mediation, arbitration and civil enforcement procedures.

LAWS3131,Term 1 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"The course focuses on legal and regulatory aspects of the Internet and related technologies. It covers topics of concern to individuals as well as business and government, including protection of intellectual property in a digital environment, electronic contracts, computer and information security, and cyber crime.  
The interaction between traditional law and modern technology plays a central role in the course. In order to analyse the impact and application of traditional legal principles in a new technological environment, the principles must be translated into the language of the technologies involved. The translation must preserve the original meaning and policy rationale. It is the aim of the course to teach, encourage and nurture such thinking. Examples of problems we shall encounter and analyze in the course include the connection between enabling technologies of cyber crime and the contours of liability of cyber criminals and their enablers; how an understanding of the Internet informs whether notice of electronic contractual terms is properly provided by a hyperlink; and determining whether an implied term of fitness for purpose can be read into a contract to download software.
A statement by Professor Lawrence Lessig captures the essence of the course: “[w]hen dealing with cyberspace, judges are to be translators; different technologies are the different languages; and the aim is to find a reading of [legal principles] that preserves [their] meaning from one world’s technology to another. This is fidelity as translation.”[1] Lawyers who fail to understand the translation will likely pursue sub-optimal litigation strategies, face speculative recovery prospects, and may overlook effective and potentially powerful defences.

LAWS3149,Summer Term 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"This unit explores the emerging complexity of the relation between Law and Biology in the 21th century. It examines the following question: What does the concept ""biology"" do in legal descriptions of events in the world. Law not just regulates, allows, or limits what can be done or undone biologically but it also defines or alters our philosophical, political or social self-understanding. Both law and biology are meaningful structures which define, diagnose, and create concepts of persons as ""nature"", ""bodies"", ""organism"", ""groups"" or ""life"" (to name just a few). ""Law and Biology"" aims to provide a historical, analytical, and critical reflection on the legal implications of biological or biologized legalities.
The unit complements other units offered at the law school such as Legal Theory, Law and Social Theory, and Theories of Law and Justice. Similarto these units, Law and Biology has an emphasis on theoretical and critical aspects of the topic and relates law to an interdisciplinary field of knowledge and legal practices. The unit also relates to units such as Law and Medical Health or Intellectual Property Law which connect law with the biomedical or biotechnological field. The main difference with the theory electives is that Law and Biology takes place in an entirely different context, the field of biology, and that its focus is on theorizing law in the contemporary world where biolegitimacy increasingly takes hold. The difference with the other units is that the Law and Biology unit does not focus on matters of litigation. Instead, it opens up a broader and theoretical horizon both in the ways law itself can be understood and how it is connected to biology and science as a method. This connection will be explained through historical, analytical and legal insights and will include reflections on the scientific and ethical questions this relation provokes in the contemporary legal system. 
Students wishing to think about law “outside the box"" and who are interested in developing a rich theoretical and interdisciplinary perspective on law combining insights from philosophy, biology, technology, sociology, neurology, psychology and ethics will surely enjoy this course. It is recommended that students have some knowledge in legal theory through having taken one of the legal theory prescribed electives before enrolling in this course. No pre-existing knowledge of biology is necessary.

The course explores the different sanctions/remedies available to regulators and private parties to assess their suitability to deal with particular scenarios.
The first part of the course will focus on analysing the different regulatory responses taken by regulators such as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority to deal with corporate (including financial) breaches of the law. This will pave the way toward studying the benefit/disadvantages of the tools available to the regulators. The second part of the course will then explores the advantages/disadvantages of private and public actions in the context of corporate breaches.
The course allows the students to evaluate the different outcomes that result from public and private actions. During the course, students will start to develop a better understanding of the different options available to regulators and private parties to deal with corporate breaches of the law and the impact that one action may have on the other.

It is a unique body of law comprising two separate and distinct bodies of rules: the jus ad bellum, which is the law governing the legality of the resort to force, and the jus in bello, which is the law regulating the conduct of hostilities. The jus in bello is also referred to as humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, or the laws of war. The law of armed conflict is a body of rules that was developed to protect the most vulnerable groups during armed conflict and to mitigate the deleterious effects of the methods of warfare.
The course is designed to provide an overview of the fundamental principles of the law of armed conflict (or international humanitarian law). It will place international humanitarian law within public international law more generally, and delineate its relationship to other areas of international law (such as the international law of human rights). Specifically, the course will cover the principles and rules relating to the protection of individuals during armed conflict, as well as rules relating to the means and methods of warfare, including weapons issues. We will also explore issues relating to the implementation and international and national enforcement of international humanitarian law.

After learning the necessary skills, students will work in small groups, in partnership with a not-for-profit centre or organisation, to design and build a legal information system.
In class, students will also be exposed to a variety of examples of automation of legal tasks, and the various legal and practical issues associated with their use, including issues of professional regulation. This will include guest lectures from those working on legal expert systems and related technologies. Students will also become familiar with theoretical approaches to legal information systems development, and the range of technologies and approaches that may contribute to applications development.
Designing legal information systems requires students to think through a class of legal problems in a structured way. Systems can be used to generate legal documents from precedents, with variations based on the responses of a user, as well as to answer legal questions within a particular field. They are one component of the increasing tendency to automate legal tasks. Used well, legal information systems can facilitate access to legal information and expertise, but always within the limits of their designer's foresight. Designing a good legal information system thus requires skills in legal analysis and problem-solving, as well as the ability to think creatively and explore different approaches to a problem.
This course does not require students to have any pre-existing skills or experience in expert systems or computer programming - the course itself includes instruction on how to use expert system software.

A minority of the world’s population grow food, and in highly urbanised countries that minority is vanishingly small. Less than 0.01% of Australians are employed in agriculture of any kind. Modern agriculture is industrialised and food production corporatized. However, across the globe, there is a growing movement to reconnect with food production and to critically examine how food reaches our tables. Researchers and food activists are highlighting the social, cultural, ethical and environmental costs of modern food production, and exploring alternatives to industrial food systems.
This course will introduce students to a broad range of legal and policy issues, at both domestic and international level, that relate to food. Drawing on the expertise of multiple teachers, topics may include:
Regulatory models that affect food production and distribution, including international covenants on food security and food aid, environmental laws, patents, trademarks, cultural heritage laws, biotechnology and health standards, animal rights, consumer laws and local government/planning law;
Biotechnology and food production, including the demise of historical prohibitions on agricultural patents and public interest litigation around patenting life forms; the distinction between discovery and invention and its consequence; the distinction between open-pollenated seeds, hybrids and GMOs; contemporary developments in agribusiness and biotech patenting; plant variety rights; seed saving and farmers’ rights;
The environment and food, including the environmental impact of nutrient and pesticide pollution, biodiversity loss and deforestation, water overuse, carbon emissions and waste; legal and regulatory regimes designed to respond to these challenges, illustrated through case studies such as the pollution of the Great Barrier Reef by agriculture run-off; the regulation of water use in agriculture (70% of the world’s water) and in the food chain (two thirds of our total water footprint), including legal rights to surface and groundwater, water planning, allocations, efficiency approaches, markets, pricing and enforcement;
Aboriginal science and rights to food, including an Indigenous Knowledges perspectives on science, agriculture and property rights to water, land, plants and animals, and data sovereignty; the regulation and use of this knowledge, including global initiatives around biopiracy; access and benefit sharing agreements; creative commons licensing; traditional knowledge databases; regional WIPO initiatives;
Diverse legal models of enterprise in the food sector, particularly those that link production and distribution in innovative ways; the intersection between the sharing economy and the food system; the potential for innovative domestic models to help realise food-related international Sustainable Development goals;
Urban agriculture, including the challenges of reconnecting overwhelmingly urban populations with food growing and production; legal rights to access land through public and private law; grassroots activism, community groups, allotments and guerrilla gardening, in Australia and overseas.

LAWS3248,"Term 2 2019, Term 3 2019","Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"This course, together with Intellectual Property 1: Copyright and Designs, collectively consider Australian intellectual property (IP) law.
IP—which encompasses the laws of copyright, designs, patents, breach of confidence, passing off and registered trade marks, as well as various related doctrines—has become one of the most important areas of commercial legal practice in recent years. It is vital to the marketing, advertising, entertainment, communications and science and technology industries. The two courses together aim to introduce students to each of the general law and statutory IP protections outlined above. For each of the heads of protection, the courses gives detailed consideration to the subject matter which is protected, the pre-conditions for protection, and the nature of infringement. Various justifications for IP are also considered, particularly in the context of new or developing forms of IP.
This course, Intellectual Property 2: Trade Marks and Patents, focuses on three aspects of Australian IP law. The first is the legal protection of business reputation, which includes the law of registered trade marks and related doctrines such as the tort of passing off. The requirements for registering marks, infringement and defences, and the elements of passing off will be canvassed, as will policy debates over the scope of legal protection. The second is the law of patents, which protects new innovations. It will cover the acquisition, ownership, exploitation and enforcement of patent rights and look at emerging issues such as the protection of biotechnology. The third is the action for breach of confidence, which protects trade secrets and personal information.
Intellectual Property 1 and Intellectual Property 2 can be taken in any order.

This fosters the assumption that litigation, or legal advice predicting the outcome of litigation, is the normal method of resolving disputes. In fact only a small proportion of disputes are resolved by litigation and there is a growing dissatisfaction with the cost, speed and adversarial character of litigation, and a corresponding interest in alternative forms of non-adjudicative dispute resolution.
This course follows on from Resolving Civil Disputes, investigating and giving practical experience in a range of alternative forms of dispute resolution including negotiation, facilitation, mediation and group process. It requires students to identify and analyse examples of the interface between the outcomes of non-adjudicative dispute resolution processes and what might be termed 'black-letter law' such as contract and revenue law.
Dispute Resolution is delivered as a skills course. Whilst there will be some formal tuition, the focus of the course is on experiential learning. Skill training depends on a building block approach to learning whereby basic ideas are built upon through group discussion, preparation, performance and review.
Because group dynamics and interaction play such an important part in the process, skills training works most effectively when it occurs in concentrated bursts of a day or more. For this reason, the course is delivered in full day sessions with an introductory lecture at the beginning.

It begins by exploring the question “what is justice”? Since this is an enduring philosophical question, posed differently at different times, it will be approached historically. We examine some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present and how they have understood justice. The focus here will be not only on explaining and critically analysing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law. The course will then put these ideas to work through a consideration of a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, how in modern circumstances might we ground the criteria of justice? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice? Is any interpretation of law always based on an understanding of legal justice? And what are we to make of various claims to justice, for instance, international justice, intergenerational justice, historical or transitional justice?

LAWS3331,"Term 1 2019, Term 2 2019, Term 3 2019","Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"This course encourages students to take a reflective interest in the study of law - its intellectual foundations, its socialconditions, its relationships with morality and politics, and its kinship with other disciplines, especially philosophy, ethicsand social theory. The course is theoretical in the following sense. In their practical, day-to-day, activities, lawyers take,and must take, much for granted: about the nature of the law, about the purposes and functions of its institutions anddoctrines, and about the worth of it all. They practise within established legal systems, with more or less settledinstitutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Customarily they think within the categories and arrangements provided bythe legal system, rather than about them.
Legal Theory is concerned to think about precisely those frameworks that lawyers think within. It aims to probe anddiscuss theoretical questions about law, which underlie the practical stuff of the law. Such questions include matters ofdescription and analysis - what's going on?; of comparison - what else goes on elsewhere and what can it tell us aboutwhat goes on here? - and of evaluation - is what is going on what should be going on? Purported answers to suchquestions are constantly assumed and relied upon in legal talk and action. Legal actors, however - like all social actors -are frequently unaware of the extent to which, or the ways in which, what they take to be perfectly obvious, natural andimpossible to imagine otherwise reflects particular, usually traditional assumptions which are questionable but are rarelyquestioned.
Legal theory examines such assumptions, clarifies the issues with which they are concerned and frequently shows theseissues to be more puzzling and contentious than is commonly assumed. It acquaints students with, and gives themopportunities to think about, question, criticise and defend, some of the most important ingredients in their own thoughtabout the law; ingredients which are all the more important for not being commonly recognised as matters of argument oreven discussion at all.
Theoretical inquiry has no predetermined 'results', or rather just one. Students will decide for themselves whether theyemerge from such inquiry with better or worse reasons to believe what they started with, or whether they should believenew or different things. On the other hand, however they begin, they are unlikely to emerge thinking that the questionsdiscussed in the course have simple, obvious or uncontroversial answers.
In general terms this course discusses the consequences for law of the present ascendancy of two basic ideas – legalpositivism as a dominant approach to understanding law and liberalism as an organising framework for thinking aboutpolitical life. Legalpositivism, basically, is the idea that the validity of law is a matter that can be worked out independentlyof non-legal (e.g. moral) concerns. A liberal understanding of politics among other things takes the conception of ourselvesas self-governing (as autonomous) as its basic value and evaluates legal practices in terms of how well or badly theycontribute to this value. Time is spent discussing these accounts of law and politics.
Along the way we discuss a number of basic ideas associated with contemporary legal/moral/political philosophy. Theseinclude - the nature of legal analysis, the separation of law from other areas of social life, the difference in moral theorybetween the right and the good, moral and personal autonomy, liberalism’s relationship to rights and to cultural andreligious difference, and law’s relationship to justice, democracy and the rule of law.

Lawyers practice within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Citizens live, and the laws operate, in societies in which specific social arrangements, structures, roles, expectations and conceptions of what is possible and what is right, are widely held and shape our views about law and about society. Customarily, most of us think within these categories and arrangements, rather than about them.
Theoretical investigation of those arrangements and understandings has to do with what underlies them. It is concerned to look beneath what we take for granted, to see what accounts for it, what its nature is, how it works and how it changes. Social theory is concerned to ask such questions about societies in which people live. Investigations about theories of law and society will lead us beyond our original and usually quite unreflectiveviews of what is important in law, what functions itplays,

what it is for, whose interests it serves and how it serves them, what causes legal change and how important law is in society. In probing these questions we might come to confirm, modify or abandon our original assumptions; we will always, however, find these assumptions are more problematic, controversial and puzzling than they appeared at first to be.
 
This course is designed to introduce students to theoretical issues concerning the intricate and complex relationships between law and society. It seeks to do this by acquainting them with several important ways of approaching these issues, and with the sorts of questions best (and worst) addressed by each of these approaches.
 
The course materials are composed of two interlocking parts, each of which seeks to introduce students to a distinct range of questions—and a distinct way of asking such questions—about socio-legal relations.

Part 1—Law and Modernity: Classical Social Theory on Law in Modern Society
 
Classical social theory was born in nineteenth century Europe, that is, at a time and in a place which was undergoing massive and unprecedented social, economic, scientific and intellectual change. The early social theories differed markedly from each other, but they agreed upon one thing: the modern west was developing in ways and at a pace which were unprecedented in European history, and unparalleled anywhere else in this world. This so-called “great transformation” formed the context and topic of classical social theory. It prompted questions which had not been considered as urgently or directly before.
 
Among these are large questions about how people can and should be expected to behave, how increasingly large and complex societies “hang together”; and what differentiates one form of society and legal order from another. Typically the law presupposes that it has the answers to such questions. But in fact these questions have a form and structure that are not amenable to traditional legal analysis: a fact which renders lawyers, who are exercising their own specialised techniques, not especially expert in answering them. Listed immediately below are some of the questions that engaged the attention of the classic founders of modern social theory and which will be covered in the course.

1. What social functions do legal systems in general play, and what functions do specific types of legal systems play?
 
2. Is law necessary (or even beneficial) for orderly social life, or is it better to dispense with it?
 
3. What are the major influences on the nature of the law and legal systems and on change in them—economic, political or internal legal imperatives; the interests of classes or other “ne",Prerequisite: Completion of 78 UOC in LAWS courses.,6 Units of Credit

It looks at particular areas of development, not only for their own sake, but also as indicators of the changing role of law in Chinese society. Areas that are the subject of particular attention include: elements and institutions of the Chinese legal system; the role of law in Chinese society from the perspectives of legal history and philosophy; contract law; intellectual property law; foreign investment law; corporate and securities law; foreign trade law; and mediation, arbitration and civil enforcement procedures.
In addition to classroom teaching, there will be field trips to Chinese legal institutions, such as a Chinese court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, an arbitration commission, and/or a Chinese law firm.

LAWS3354,Term 2 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"Trade remedies are the most popular area in international trade law practice and the most adjudicated at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). They are actions taken by governments to counteract “dumping” through antidumping measures, subsidies through countervailing measures, and unexpected increases in the volume of imports through safeguard measures, for the protection of domestic industries. A typical form of these measures is an imposition of additional import duties on the top of the standard ones. WTO members are free to resort to trade remedies but must follow the relevant WTO rules.
This course offers a comprehensive and detailed study of the laws and practice of trade remedies. It studies the rationale for trade remedies; the domestic law and practice in selected countries with a focus on Australia (as an active user of trade remedies) and China (as a major target of trade remedies worldwide); the relevant WTO rules and major dispute settlement cases; negotiations of reforms of WTO rules on trade remedies; and the regulation of trade remedies under free trade agreements (FTAs). The course offers abundant opportunities for students to gain legal expertise and practical experience through case studies, simulation, and face-to-face discussion with leading trade and commercial lawyers. As the laws and practice of trade remedies in different jurisdictions share common features and create common issues, this course will provide the knowledge and practical skills necessary for further studies and trade law practice in all major jurisdictions (e.g. Australia, China, the US, the EU, Canada, and India).",Prerequisite: Completion of 78 UOC in LAWS courses.,6 Units of Credit

The second part of the course examines criticisms of the link between constitutionalism and popular sovereignty that emerged in response to the revolutionary movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. These will include Marxist and anarchist claim that the state cannot realise popular self-determination and so needs to be eliminated through revolution, and the reactionary argument that democracy undermines law, order and morality. The final section of the course explores the radical democratic turn of critical theory since the 1970s and its tendency to critique law and rights while appropriating them for emancipatory politics. The course will situate these theories in their historical context and examine their contemporary relevance in the activities of existing social movements. Students will emerge from the course with a knowledge of theories of law and democracy that have shaped political history.  They will also develop a critical understanding of the strengths and limitations of law and revolutionary politics as vehicles for realising democratic aspirations.",Prerequisite: Completion of 78 UOC in LAWS courses.,6 Units of Credit

LAWS3623,Term 3 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"The Criminal Trial is a course that grounds the study of the criminal trial by contextualising the impact of the law of evidence and advocacy practice while building on students' basic knowledge of the doctrine, principles and rules relating to criminal litigation. It builds on and extends students' studies in criminal law, criminal procedure, the law of evidence, legal profession and various clinical and experiental law courses, including Kingsford Legal Centre. It does this by providing a multidisciplinary framework that explicates the role of participants in the criminal trial process. Classroom discussion focuses on commentaries examining a variety of issues associated with the dynamics of criminal trials. These issues vary from year to year, allowing for topical themes to be developed but they include comparative analysis, human rights principles and various multidisciplinary  perspectives including, the observations of historians, psychologists, sociologists, architects and linguists. A practice-orientation is an important component of the course as it assists to develop the rhetoric/reality theme that guides the course. It is fulfilled through guest speakers such as barristers and trial judges and through students fieldwork obligations.  Outside classroom hours students must attend and observe criminal trials in progress. This observation requirement is built into the final assessment, which is an essay based comparing the conduct and practices of participants in observed trials with what the law expects, requires or assumes exists in relation to those participants.
Outside classroom hours students must attend and observe criminal trials in progress. This enables students to not only learn about trial practice first hand but, with classroom discussion and the readings, better appreciate its relationship to doctrinal theory. The observation requirement is also built into the final assessment, which is an essay-based analysis with a choice between two topics. One topic asks students to compare the conduct and practices of participants in observed trials withwhat the law expects, requires or assumes. The other (alternate) topic requires students to explore a miscarriage of justice scenario of their own choice. Finally, a number of guest speakers, such as barristers and trial judges, will contribute to the course.

The course will focus of all aspects of sustainable energy law and policy, including those involving property law, land use planning, and utility regulation.  It will particularly focus on unresolved legal and policy questions relating to wind and solar energy development.  However, it will also include coverage of issues involving geothermal energy, biomass, biofuels, hydropower, and other important renewable energy technologies.
The course will also provide an examination of the role of nuclear energy in Australia and in other countries. It will examine specific policy issues affecting the regulation and management of the nuclear industry.
The course will conclude by exploring several legal and regulatory challenges emerging as Australia and other nations of the world seek to transition toward a more sustainable energy system, including issues related to energy storage technologies, smart meters and electric vehicles.

Interns are required to attend at their partner organisation or centre for at least the equivalent of one day each week over 12 weeks, by arrangement between the intern and the partner organisation or centre. Many students may choose to do extra days.
 
The range of projects in which the intern will be involved will be determined according to the project priorities of the partner organisation or affiliated centre. However, in general it is expected that an intern’s duties will consist of a combination of advocacy, research, project administrative work, interviewing clients, preparing legal materials editing, writing, event coordination, preparing background materials, briefing papers, liaising with other organisations and doing relevant work of a substantive nature.
 
Interns are required to attend seminars, to read the course materials, and actively participate in the online forums on moodle. These are designed to promote discussion and reflection on a range of issues that may arise during the course of the internship – for example, legal, professional, ethical and personal issues. They may also address the application of skills such as legal research, legal writing, advocacy and interviewing.
 
Attendance by interns at the partner organisation or centre and at the program seminars is mandatory. Students whose attendance falls below the specified 12 days (or equivalent) or who do not attend meetings with their supervisors and program seminars without a medical certificate or other adequate evidence will be deemed not to have completed the subject requirements and will not be eligible to pass the subject.  If circumstances mean that you are going to have difficulty meeting this requirement, you need to discuss this with student services (experiential learning officer) at the earliest possible opportunity.",Prerequisite: Academic Program must be either  9200 or 9201 or 9231 or 9235 or 9285 or 9214 or 9281 or 9240.,6 Units of Credit

Innovative technologies include robotics, cryptography, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and smart contracts. These technologies are being applied to provide more affordable, accessible and inclusive financial services. These technologies will also deliver more effective financial regulatory solutions. However, the FinTech revolution also poses new challenges to policymakers, regulators and legal practitioners because it brings increased risks particularly in the areas of consumer protection and data privacy.
Laws underpinning financial regulation will need to be adjusted to remain responsive and relevant. Contemporary regulatory approaches, such as ‘Regulatory Sandboxes’, need to be implemented in a way which balances innovation, risk mitigation and financial inclusion.
This course will provide students with a basic understanding of the FinTech revolution and the implications for financial law and regulation (including RegTech).
The course will focus on market developments and regulatory trends which are being shaped by, and are themselves shaping, the FinTech revolution.

What would constitute an ideal regulatory and remedial framework on the human rights impacts of business activity? What legal, commercial, political or social forces and factors shape these issues in practice?
Delivered both online and with 2 days of face-to-face teaching, this course analyses the source, nature, content and practical significance of legal, regulatory, self-regulatory and other frameworks governing the ways in which business actors and activities might affect human rights. 
This course addresses complex issues such as attempts to establish a legal basis for arguing corporations must respect human rights; alleged corporate complicity in forced labour in the construction or fishing industries, supply chain regulation in the manufacturing industry; and the obligation of technology companies to respect free speech. With a focus on practical case studies students will be exploring the nexus of two of the most profound social and regulatory phenomena of our time: economic globalisation, and the international human rights narrative.
Through moderated discussions both online and in the classroom and with occasional guest expert input, students navigate some key issues. How can business activity affect the enjoyment of human rights? How effective are existing regulatory responses, and what undermines these? What is the role for business self-regulation, and what is the state's duty to control the social impacts of a business operating abroad? What avenues of remedy exist or should exist? Is a binding international treaty needed? How do companies operate in conflict zones?

It examines the notion of complementary protection (how human rights law has expanded States' protection obligations), the role of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the causes of and possible solutions to refugee flows, and the political and ethical issues concerning refugees and other forced migrants, including people trafficking and smuggling. It also examines strategies that countries like Australia have adopted in an attempt to deter asylum seekers, such as detention, interdiction, deflection, and temporary protection, as well as legal constructs devised to shift responsibility to other States, such as the concepts of 'safe third country', 'internal flight alternative', and extraterritorial processing.

In most States the border is the point at which citizens and migrants (non-citizens) are distinguished and legal controls of the movement of migrant populations are focused. Control over the entry, stay and rights of non-citizens is a defining feature of State sovereignty and allows a State to determine the boundaries of the membership of its political community. 
The course adopts a thematic and theoretical approach to examining the legal regulation internationally and by States of the entry and stay of migrants and the status and rights conferred on citizens and non-citizens. It begins with an analysis of the theoretical approaches to global movements of people, including the relationship between the international legal context, State sovereignty, border control and citizenship and individual rights. It then examines the power of the State to refuse entry to, detain and exclude migrants from its territory and to grant, deny or withdraw citizenship status as embodied in the policies and domestic laws of the State and the international legal context in which the movement of people takes place.

As consumers, we purchase services every day – be they retail banking, using a supermarket or restaurant, a holiday, medical services, transportation, visiting immigration consultants, travel agents or hairdressers (higher education is also a service!). Professional services (of a B2B or B2C nature) are equally prominent and include legal services, financial planning, accountancy, architects, management consultancy, financial services, information technology, market research, and engineering services.

MARK6105,Term 1 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"The strategic management of customer relationships is a critical activity for all enterprises. The means of effectively managing relationships with customers is addressed under the headings of relationship marketing and customer relationship management (CRM). Over the last two decades, relationship marketing has become an increasingly important topic. Organisations have learned that building relationships and sustaining them is usually more important than activities focused on customer acquisition. This course first examines the key principles of relationship marketing including: the shift from a functional to a cross functional orientation; the emphasis on business processes; the integration of customer service and quality with marketing; trust, commitment, satisfaction and loyalty as building blocks of relationships; the drivers and scope of relationships, and a focus on multiple stakeholders beyond the enterprise-customer relationship. The course then addresses customer relationship management, which involves an enterprise-wide customer-centric approach to maximising customer value. It is aimed at creating long-lasting and profitable relationships with individual customers - in both B2B and B2C contexts. Developments in technology have allowed organizations to look at their customers as individuals and to gather, store and analyse customer-based information. An outcome is an increase in the use of direct marketing techniques such as those for designing and managing consumer databases and customer service centres.

MARK6111,Term 3 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"Globalisation is the process by which firms operate on a global basis, organising their structure, capabilities resources and people in such a way as to address the world as a single market. It is natural however that marketing practices will vary from country to country, and culture, economic and social circumstances, and societal infrastructure are different. These differences mean that a successful marketing approach in one country will not automatically work in another country. Customer preferences, competition, distribution channels and communications media differ. Global marketing requires marketers to behave in ways that are global and local at the same time by responding to similarities and differences in various markets. An important task in global marketing is learning to recognize the extent to which marketing plans and programs might be standardised worldwide as well as the extent to which they need to be adapted. The decision to enter markets outside the home country depends on a firm's resources, managerial attitudes, and the nature and extent of opportunities and threats. This gives rise to important themes in international marketing: market entry, partnering and strategic alliances, managing across borders, grey markets - these are some of the key issues dealt with in this course.",Prerequisite: MARK5700 or MARK5800,6 Units of Credit

MATH2701,Term 3 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"Mathematics went through quite a revolution around the turn of the 20th century. In particular, an axiomatic approach infiltrated the mathematical paradigm, both as a tool to ensure mathematical rigour and to abstract common principles working in a variety of different settings.
First year mathematics emphasizes computation over abstraction and rigour. Later year courses (and Pure Mathematics in general) reverse this, so students need to learn some new skills and some new ways of thinking about mathematical objects.
This course is designed to help you develop the ability to write rigorous mathematical proofs in a setting where the level of abstraction is still quite modest. As such it will serve as an excellent preparation for the third year Pure Mathematics courses.
The course consists of two halves, algebra and analysis, each taught for 6 weeks.
Analysis half. Most of the calculus you have seen involves equalities. Mathematical analysis however, is largely about inequalities, about suitably bounding quantities that cannot be calculated precisely. Many nice examples come from geometry and we will frequently use these to motiva????te our discussion in the first part of the analysis section. In the latter part we will look more closely at some aspects of the real numbers, such as how well one can approximate π by a rational p/?? (in terms of how large ?? is).
Algebra half. We will investigate various transformations on the plane and projective plane. We will first study several types of transformations such as translations, reflections, rotations etc. in terms of groups. We will then look at symmetries, i.e. transformations of geometric figures that preserve some property (such as distance or angles between lines), and projective geometry. Projective transformations can change a conic section of one type to another, e.g. an ellipse to a hyperbola.","Prerequisite: MATH1231 or MATH1241 or MATH1251 with at least a CR, enrolment in an advanced maths or advanced science program",6 Units of Credit

MATH3121,Term 1 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"This course builds on MATH2120 Mathematical Methods for Differential Equations in that it is concerned with ways of solving the (usually partial) differential equations that arise mainly in physical, biological and engineering applications.
Analytical methods have considerable intrinsic interest, but their importance for applications is the driving motive behind this course. The main analytical tools developed in this course can be thought of as generalisations of the Fourier and power series representations of functions studied in MATH2120. This leads to new types of functions and to practical methods for solving differential equations. We will pay special attention to functions defined on infinite domains.
The course begins by characterising different partial differential equations (PDEs), and exploring similarity solutions and the method of characteristics to solve them. The Fourier transform, the natural extension of a Fourier series expansion is then investigated. For functions of time, the Fourier transform corresponds to the “spectrum” of the function or signal in the problem in the frequency domain. Closely related to the Fourier transform is the Laplace transform which is particularly useful for solving the initial value PDEs that arise in many physical applications. Although contour integration is an intrinsic part of using these transforms, only brief references to complex variable methods will be made.
Transforms give a wide insight into the behaviour of a function and suggests other possibilities for the integral representation of solutions of PDEs. By exploiting certain special solutions of a given linear PDE we eventually obtain the idea of a Green's function for the PDE and a corresponding integral form for the solution. The power of Green's functions can be observed in their use as the inverses of differential operators on both infinite and bounded domains.
Frequently it is not possible to evaluate in closed form the Fourier, Laplace or Green’s function integrals appearing in the solution of the given PDE. All is not lost as we can still explore the asymptotic behaviour of these integrals at large parameter values and obtain physically useful information on the solution of the underlying problem.","Prerequisite: 12 units of credit in Level 2 Math courses including (MATH2011 or MATH2111) and (MATH2120 or MATH2130 or MATH2121 or MATH2221), or (both MATH2019 (DN) and MATH2089), or (both MATH2069 (DN) and MATH2099)",6 Units of Credit

Communication design: multimodality, meaning, and media
Communication tends to be thought of and analysed in terms of specific modes such as 'writing', 'image', or 'sound', and these are very often analysed in isolation from each other. But communication is never as clear-cut as that. Something as seemingly-straightforward as 'writing' in fact has a visual component (how it looks), and a material component (what it is produced on and with). And we also communicate through many other modes - such as through the design of objects and buildings, the sorts of networks we create through digital media, or the actions we undertake in daily life. In this course, you will extend your understanding of communication by investigating underlying principles of communication design, the range of modes we communicate with, and the complex nature of all forms of communication. We will investigate particular modes in depth, and explore how they work together. You will develop research skills which allow you to critique and evaluate the design of multimodal communication, especially in terms of its contribution to contemporary society.","Prerequisite: 66 units of credit overall, including ARTS2093 or ARTS2094, and enrolment in a single or dual award Media program",6 Units of Credit

All students will enrol in MFAC 3501-3509 and may enrol in additional courses, depending on whether they have undertaken earlier individualised study programs or have been granted any exemptions.
Objectives: - By completion of Phase 3, students will be expected to demonstrate an integrated achievement of the eight desired capabilities specified as appropriate for graduates to practice as interns. These include a thorough understanding of the biomedical science mechanisms and bio-social determinants that maintain health, contribute to illness, and underlie appropriate management strategies; application of a scientific approach to clinical medicine and medical practice; excellent communicative, teamwork, psychomotor and cognitive skills to assess health issues and patient problems and develop patient-centred management approaches; and demonstrated abilities to work independently, reflectively and within appropriate ethical and legal frameworks.
Clinical learning in phase 3 will be predominantly located in clinical environments associated with the Faculty of Medicine in a range of metropolitan and rural locations throughout New South Wales. Most modules will be available in a variety of clinical locations and students will be able to select an individualised learning program from a menu offered by clinical teaching units, or they may be able to negotiate their program with their clinical supervisors. Students will generally be able to indicate a preference to do the majority of their clinical training attached to one geographical region, but final allocation will be determined by a number of factors including availability of attachments to particular locations, and is ultimately the responsibility and decision of the Faculty. 
Students are required to complete one each of six clinical modules with a specified major focus, these being in the clinical disciplines of Children's Health; Women's Health; Mental Health; Internal Medicine; Surgery; and Chronic & Complex Care, although some choice of the structure, case-mix and location of each of these will generally be possible. In addition to these specified modules, students may choose from a range of other available clinical modules to complete phase 3 requirements. The order and content of work undertaken in these courses will be organised for each student on an individual basis through the relevant Clinical School(s).
In considering their choice of modules in Phase 3, the student's clinical experience must include a minimum of 8 weeks in community or ambulatory settings, as well as 8 weeks experience of emergency or critical care, although these may be spread over one or more individual modules. In addition, a student's combined clinical experiences during phases 2 and 3 must include a minimum of 8 weeks in rural locations, 4 weeks in primary care practice and adequate exposure to various clinical sub-specialities. 
All clinical modules in phase 3 adopt the principles of clinical clerkship, in which students learn through experience and participation in the treatment of patients under the care of medical practitioners and/or medical teams to which they are attached. Although structured teaching activities are generally limited to an average of 10 hours per week, which will include teaching of relevant biomedical sciences and social sciences, students are required to work under supervision as part of the health care delivery unit. Students' responsibilities as part of the team will increase gradually as new skills are developed. Each module will have demonstrable links to those aspects of basic biomedical and social sciences relevant to the health issues encountered.

MMAN2100,Term 3 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"This course focuses on the subject of engineering design, which plays the role in guiding an engineer or a team of engineers to think like a designer along a systemic, rational, and creative pathway, towards breakthrough innovations of new product/service. This course provides students with a holistic understanding of the big picture, wide spectrum, and structured process of engineering design. In particular, it focuses on the early stage design, with respect to functional design and conceptual design, which greatly determines the ultimate success of any new product development.
Unlike the purely technical engineering subjects, engineering design is characterized by the synergy between “analysis” and “synthesis”, between “rationality” and “optimality”, as well as between “do the right thing” and “do the thing right”. Therefore, this course aims to make you understand the socio-technical nature of engineering design, and provide you with the capacity of not only solving a given design problem using relevant engineering knowledge, but also formulating a new design problem. 
Design thinking is a fundamental skill that every engineer must have for the 21st Century. It is one of the skills that profoundly distinguish human intelligence from artificial intelligence, which greatly impacts an engineer’s long-term career success in the workplace. Therefore, this course aims to equip you with the domain-independent and solution-neutral design thinking, which can be applied to whatever technical stream (e.g., aerospace, mechanical, manufacturing, mechatronic, or naval engineering) you choose to pursue in the future.

This course builds on the knowledge and skills gathered in Strategic Policy Tools, but has a specific focus on implementation. The intention of the course is two-fold. In the first instance the course provides students with a tool-kit of policy instruments to translate urban strategy into tangible programs and outcomes. Students are introduced to an array of tools across four broad categories: (1) regulatory and legal tools, (2) financial and economic tools, (3) governance and management tools, and (4) communication tools. For each of the tools, the course instructs students on when and how they should be deployed and examines issues that may arise in their practical application. The second aim of the course is to provide students with an understanding of the methods used to evaluate and assess the success of urban policy programs, including cost-benefit analysis, performance targets and benchmarking. The course will be delivered through lectures as well as seminars delivered by professionals who have had experience in implementation of urban policy. At the end of the course students will participate in a group policy project where they will be required to develop an implementation strategy using the policy tools and assessment methods used in the course.","Currently enrolled in program 8313, 5313 or 7313  Urban Policy and Strategy",6 Units of Credit

Music is part of the life of people everywhere, and as George Eliot once said, there is no feeling, except the extremes of fear and grief, that does not find relief in music. Universal though these truths might appear to be, the various musical expressions of the world’s peoples are as diverse, unique, and sometimes strange, as the natural and cultural worlds that make them. Today we can access that musical diversity easily. We can buy it, download it, iPod it. But just how much do we know about the peoples, histories, sentiments, and lives of the musicians and singers that produce this music? How much do we grasp the beauty, the yearning, and the spirituality in that music? What can we learn that will deepen our appreciation, understanding, and perhaps performance of the many musical expressions available to us today?
This World Music course surveys and examines the relationships between music, the society in which it is performed, and individual selves. It explores both traditional and contemporary music of Aboriginal Australia, South-east Asia, India, Central Asia and the Middle East, West Africa and the Caribbean, and marginal Europe.

Any musicological investigation requires a sound understanding of sources and methods, and this course will provide you with that understanding. Since the course is core to the Musicology Stream, inquiry itself is the primary focus. The course therefore begins with questions: how do musicologists conceive of the music they listen to? how are those conceptions communicated to others? how do ideas about music change historically? what methods have been developed to hone musical ideas? The aim of musicology is always to persuade others of how you hear music, whether your approach to music is through biographical study, manuscript study (paleography, editions, publication history and considerations, marked scores), primary source study, analysis, organology, iconography, criticism, aesthetics, hermeneutics, reception history, performance studies, transcription, music psychology, or ethnography. To better understand hearing, we will study how others have listened to music, and how that listening has formed both musicological writing and newly created music.","Prerequisite: 36uoc in Level 1 Music courses, and enrolment in a Music single or dual degree program.

Since its beginnings around a century ago, jazz has consistently enthused listeners with the inventiveness, expressiveness and virtuosity of its performers, and the variety of its styles. Beginning with African American chants, field hollers, early blues and urban dance forms, this course traces a history of the music, outlining the development and details of various styles of jazz, both in the United States and abroad. Tracing the changing locations in which the music has developed, it examines the roles of individual artists and musical collectivities in the innovation of styles. It investigates the dissemination of jazz through emerging media technologies, and notes the influence of other music on jazz musicians: popular music, rhythm and blues, soul, rock, classical music and world music, such as Latin American music, French gypsy music, South African kwela and mbqanga. As jazz has become the scintillating soundtrack to many lives, the course examines both the practical use of jazz as sound and image in film, literature and the visual arts, and some of the many meanings listeners have ascribed to it.

In this course you will learn some key methods of musical transformation. We will begin with orchestration, which transforms music for a single instrument into music that involves a stage full of performers. Orchestration also requires careful decisions about adding new materials, removing old material, adapting, multiplying, and spatialising musical ideas, all of which will be discussed in terms of historical models (including Mozart, Brahms, Wagner, and Adès, for example). The second part of the course revolves around a question: how have composers used old music to make new music? In answering this question we will focus on transformation itself, and we will examine in detail a wide range of recent re-compositions of earlier music (including Halvorsen, Ives, Berio, Schnittke, Nyman and Adams, for example).

The Program Authority will determine, with the student and relevant organisation, a suitable internship placement and the proposed scope and focus of workplace activities with which the student can meaningfully engage and contribute to, for the duration of their internship. The activities and focus of the internship placement will be relevant to the organisation and student and can be either project or normal operations-based.
The internship course draws on an evidence informed approach from recent higher education research in practice based education (Higgs 2012), inquiry based learning (Savery 2006) and negotiated work based learning (Costley & Lester 2009).  Collectively this research suggests imbuing courses with a strong ethos of reflexivity and practitioner inquiry.  In particular it suggests that the following features provide a robust basis for fostering high level practitioner capacities from engagement in work placements:
Negotiated work-based learning agreements involving the university, workplace organisation and student, focusing on agreed workplace activities and production of a workplace relevant product/report
Full-time immersion in the workplace to support practitioner development and understanding of organisational context, realities and operational rhythms and challenges
During the placement, students will have two supervisors (one academic, one workplace based) and will be required to undertake 160 hours in the workplace (approximately 20 hours/week over 8 weeks. The way the course is structured provides time for Schon's reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action,  both essential elements for the integration of knowledge, skills and experience. It also matches the requirements of internships of other disciplines with practice based courses.
Under the guidance of the workplace supervisor, students will have the opportunity to work independently and as part of a team to complete the tasks set. Students will be assessed on their negotiated internship agreement and a written report. A list of generic capabilities/activities available to students during placements will inform the negotiated internship agreement. A portion of their submitted report will also include a reflective piece on the implications for future professional practice drawing upon the internship experience and relevant themes from within the student’s Master's Program.

PHCM9331,Term 3 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"The aim of this course is to consider ethics and law in public health and in the management of health care institutions. The course includes an introduction to ethics and explores the ethical challenges of balancing the interests of individuals and society within a healthcare context. Differences between the strong community focus of public health ethics and the more individual focus of clinical ethics are also studied. An introductory briefing on health law is provided together with discussions on common issues of concern relating to public health and health management law. Students are given opportunities to apply their learning to particular issues of interest in public health and health care management.
The course is offered in external mode and involves weekly online tutorials as well as a compulsory one day Foundations Workshop at the start of the course.
The course aims to deliver knowledge and skills in identifying ethical and legal issues in health care policy development by reference to some recurring tensions:  Balancing individual rights with the goal of achieving healthy populations; the challenges of health care rationing; and addressing the needs of particular groups.  We will bring these issues to life through a series of case studies, including tobacco control policy, the 'obesity epidemic'?, pandemic influenza, involuntary treatment for mental illness, vaccination policy and cancer screening. These case studies form the basis of online discussions and provide a practical anchor for developing students' understanding of the relevant ethical and legal issues.
Perhaps more than any other discipline, discussion and collaboration is the key to ethical decision making.  Communication with stakeholder groups and drawing on expertise across a range of disciplines including economics, law, sociology, the various health care professions, research fields including epidemiology, infection control and so on, are central to creating policy and designing appropriate and effective laws.  Online group discussions are central to students learning in this course as students will learn from each other, drawing on the diverse experiences and interestrests in the student group, as well as from the course materials.

You may be one of those people who asks yourself ""what economics has to do with health and health care?"" For some people, economics seems quite at odds with fundamental social goals such as  'good health'. The answer lies in the fact that resources are inevitably scarce and choices have to be made about their allocation. Health economics is about the optimisation of health relative to other activities and making choices to use resources in ways that improve health and service delivery within the limited resources available. Health economics can provide insight into questions like:  Which is the more effective method of increasing the uptake of health services: price-controls or subsidies? How will the involvement of the private sector in the funding and delivery of health care affect access to it? What are the most cost-effective mechanisms for delivering essential medicines to those living in remote areas? Are out of pocket payments for health care a regressive funding mechanism? How should doctors be paid? The primary goal of this course is to provide participants with the knowledge, skills, and basic economic arguments that are central to discussions about health policy options and resource allocation choices in low and middle income countries. By the end of the course, students will be in a stronger position to (i) Demonstrate understanding of the main functions and challenges facing health systems in the developing world; (ii) explain the key economic principles and concepts relevant to health economics and financing; (iii) discuss specific features that distinguish markets for health care from markets for other goods and services; (iv) distinguish between the principal ways of funding health services and paying health care providers; and (v) critically appraise evidence on the efficiency and equity implications of health financing reforms in low and middle income countries.",Prerequisite: Students who are not enrolled in a postgraduate program in the School of Public Health and Community Medicine will need to provide approval from their program authority and the approval of the course convenor to postgrad-sphcm@unsw.edu.au,6 Units of Credit

In EIDM you will be introduced to different types of decision-making and the level of evidence you will need to make different types of decisions in health services management. Some decisions need evidence and to obtain evidence you will learn how to search the literature for evidence related to a health services issue. Some decisions require the highest level quality of evidence so you will be introduced to study designs applied in medical research and epidemiological principles to evaluate the methodological shortfalls associated with the different designs. Other decisions need lower levels of evidence and you will learn about the appropriateness and flaws of methods for collecting lower level evidence. With this knowledge you will be able to determine the level of evidence you require to make a decision and critically appraise the evidence for flaws. You will also learn to interpret commonly used statistical techniques in health related and health services research.

PHCM9787,Term 3 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"Approximately one out of every 20 hospitalised patients contracts a healthcare associated infection, of which around half are preventable. These infections add to the functional disability and emotional stress of the patient and in some cases, lead to disabling conditions that reduce the quality of life. In addition, they contribute to increased hospital stays and added expense to the healthcare system. Professional organisations for infection control, patient safety and quality and healthcare epidemiology have published numerous evidence-based guidelines relating to the practice of health care infection control. However, there are numerous organisational, environmental and behavioural factors which impact on the success of the strategies outlined in these guidelines.

Infectious diseases intelligence refers to the understanding of epidemic patterns and the application of this knowledge to effective disease control. Infectious diseases contribute significantly to the global burden of disease and remain leading causes of death across the world. Emerging and re-emerging infections such as pandemic influenza, Ebola, dengue, chikungunya and MERS Corona Virus (CoV) pose an additional public health challenge and require coordinated and systematic disease control responses. A multi-disciplinary, public health approach is needed to understand the requirements for infectious diseases control at a population level. This course uses case studies to teach epidemiologic disease pattern recognition, identification of aberrant patterns, and interpretation of epidemic and surveillance data to inform disease control. An overview of field epidemiology methods and mathematical modeling of infectious diseases will also be provided.

PLAN2004,Term 2 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"Equitable Cities examines contemporary issues facing planners working in a diverse and complex society. Students engage with the broader social, economic and cultural shifts which are continually reshaping the neoliberal city. Students consider questions of spatial disadvantage, social exclusion, ‘spatial justice’ and equity, and ‘rights to the city’. Change in the built environment invariably impacts on disadvantaged and disenfranchised groups disproportionately, where for example redevelopment and gentrification may be accompanied by quickly changing community profiles, rising housing costs, unhealthy environments and potential displacement. As planners we must steward the future direction of our cities and communities in ways which value and foster diversity. Planners must ensure that the interests and needs of all groups, including ethnic communities, children, the aged, women, people with disabilities, people of all sexual preferences, Indigenous and homeless people are heard. Planners are also increasingly engaged with the creation of healthy built environments, fostering wellbeing alongside health professionals in decisions taken which affect the built environment's ability to be supportive of healthy behaviour.

PLAN2007,Term 3 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"The nexus between transport and land use planning has been a longstanding focus of interest for city planners, in terms of understanding patterns of mobility, determining the need for appropriate transport infrastructure ensuring planning frameworks optimise the benefits to both local communities and the wider city of transport and other infrastructure networks and future investment. In recent years, interest in maximising the strategic synergies between infrastructure expenditure and urban growth, development and renewal has become increasingly framed by the notion of 'city building'. The reassertion of strategic planning interests in the role that urban infrastructure projects play in 'city building' are acting to reposition the role of the planner, and demand a range of skills that help tie these large financial (and political) commitments more coherently to considerations of city productivity, efficiency and equity. This course introduces students to the centrality of transport and infrastructure considerations both within strategic and statutory contexts.

Proactively, we are also interested in creating healthy built environments, and fostering wellbeing in decisions taken which affect the built environment. The role and capacity of current planning frameworks to achieve more equitable outcomes are explored, including the preparation of community strategic plans, the use of social impact assessment as well as more creative inter-disciplinary and bottom-up approaches.",No Prerequisites,6 Units of Credit

In the first part of City Building: Infrastructure Planning, the policy context and practical aspects of the planning, funding, provision, and maintenance of urban infrastructure are considered. This highlights the complex and often contradictory interplay between different levels of Government in shaping the policy and financing context within which infrastructure requirements are identified, prioritised, funded and delivered. Urban management and governance structures to provide urban infrastructure, along with methods for assessing the feasibility of major projects, are considered. Students will also be challenged to engage with the transformative nature of digital technologies and the rise of ‘smart’ and ‘ubiquitous’ cities, challenging the physicality and form of the types of ‘infrastructure’ that afford the potential for, as well as require, urban planners to think about changing urban environments in innovative ways.

The Intelligence and Thinking strand will address questions like: What is intelligence? Do IQ tests really measure intelligence (and if not, what DO they measure)? The Judgment and Decision-making asks and answers questions like: Do we make rational decisions? Are we constrained to fall prey to systematic biases when we make judgments? Are we risk averse and if so what does that mean? It will also cover the burgeoning field of “behavioural insights” and the tools to ‘nudge’ people to change their behaviour.  The (Models of) Memory strand focuses on the development and testing of computational models of working memory and long-term memory. The component is focused on how quantitative instantiations of models are necessary to provide a rigorous test of psychological theories.  The Categorisation and Reasoning strand examines how and why people organise things in their physical and social environment into groups (e.g., dogs vs. cats, male vs. female, left-wing politician vs. right-wing politician)?, and how to they use such knowledge to reason and make predictions.","Prerequisite: PSYC2001 , PSYC2071",6 Units of Credit

We begin from the understanding that policy-making is political in nature because the distribution of power among and between the groups and individuals involved is unequal. Therefore, as we study policy making as a political process we highlight the fact that making policy involves conflict and cooperation; struggles for power, influence and authority; and includes groups and individuals both inside and outside government.
The course will examine both the problems and methods of decision-making in the modern state from the perspective of a range of differently situated 'policy workers'.

The arrival of a baby into a family is an intensely emotional experience. If new parents are able to support one another and negotiate the challenges of becoming a family, it is a time for learning and growth. For some families, however, this experience is fundamentally challenging and coping well with the changes remains elusive.
The transition to parenthood is widely acknowledged as a period of great change. It is also a time of increased psychological vulnerability. Although emotional upheaval is normal, the vulnerability of this period can have important consequences from the standpoint of the mother and father, their infant, and their family. The phenomenon of perinatal depression in parents is well recognised. In Australia, 29% of women are likely to develop a depressive or anxiety disorder in the first 6-8 months postpartum. There is also a growing body of evidence showing that infant growth and development can be influenced by the psychological health of his or her parents.
This six module course explores the psychological processes associated with pregnancy and the first year postpartum. The course covers a range of topics, from the psychology of pregnancy, to bonding and attachment, mood disorders in the perinatal period, infant psychological growth and development, and interventions to support parents, infants and families who experience difficulties. The course focuses not only on evidence-based practice, but also the latest research findings and their implications for future clinical and research initiatives in the field.

Often, the latter relationship is not caught by the main taxation regimes. Remuneration for services also is often provided in non-cash form. This course examines all the key Australian tax regimes that apply to employee remuneration and situations closely analogous to employee remuneration. While the main focus is the various regimes under the federal income tax (e.g. employment termination payments, employee share schemes), the following are also covered: state payroll tax obligations of employers, superannuation guarantee obligations of employers and fringe benefits tax. In addition, there is also a focus on tax collection and remittance obligations of employers under the PAYG regime. Under the income tax, the course also examines the treatment of personal services income in the context of attempts to alienate such income (and reduce tax) through use of an interposed entity.",Prerequisite: TABL2751 or LEGT2751 or 48 units of credit completed in BTax.,6 Units of Credit

ZGEN2240,Summer Canberra 2019,UNSW Canberra at ADFA ,1,0,"A changing military environment and developments in wider society combine to make new and increasingly complex ethical demands on Australian Defence Force officers. This course introduces students to ethical theory and debate, develops skills in applying ethics, and analyses various forms of ethical discourse. In order to maintain a practical approach, case studies will be used to introduce the problems to be examined in the course. Studying ethics may not make you a better person, but it will encourage self-awareness, clarity, and ability to engage in ethical dialogue with others inside and outside the military.",Prerequisite: 36 Units of Credit in Level 1 courses,6 Units of Credit
