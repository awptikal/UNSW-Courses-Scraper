The course is situated in the 'Beginner Level' in the CoDe student specialisation journey and therefore available for enrolment as an elective for all other UNSW undergrad students.
In the early nineties, the concept of the paperless studio and the integration of digital media into design practice; the 'digital turn', were considered to be merely experiments undertaken by the avant-garde. Today, computation is embedded in all aspects of design practice from conception to construction. New digital design techniques have been joined by new methodologies and formal outcomes. The representation of design has greater sophistication and we understand more about the effects of digital imagery. Computation has also infiltrated the construction of our built environment, from materiality to management. Highly complex information systems process, analyse and integrate components in 3D virtual spaces.
Computation is ubiquitous in our built environment, and its integration has had significant effect on the culture of the design and built environment. The interest we have in technology has moved beyond merely the creation of blob architecture into the new possibilities and challenges it offers to parametrics, sustainability and fabrication. This course will explore the elaborate relationship between computer, the designer and the design and construction of our built environment. The semester's lectures will help in better understanding the relationships and effect of the continual change and evolution on the social and cultural aspects of our design practices. A range of bridging theories essential to the 'digital turn' in building information management, information modelling, as well as the agency for simulation and optimization will be introduced. For example, pre-BIM design concepts; agency in architecture; visualization; materiality and material practice; robotics and making, BIM in practice and so on.
Students will have an opportunity to develop their understanding of ideas and issues through their participation in a critical discussion group. Theoretical understanding will be expanded and formalised through online activities and through illustrated writing exercises, which will be presented in class.

Particularly, this aims to unpack assumptions that ""technology is the simple application of science, and that technology is all for the good"" (Dusek 2006). This course will focus on four key questions (1) What is technology? How do we define it, study it, and understand it in relation to nature and society? (2) What is the impact of technology on society, culture, and ethics? How can we think about this impact? Where is technology beneficial, and where is it problematic? (3) In what ways is technology understood in design practice and design thinking?

COMM5201,Term 2 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"A social enterprise, broadly defined, is a 'for profit' organisation that has a social or environmental mission at the core of what it does. Whilst social enterprises might have different legal structures and reinvest or redistribute profits in different ways, they are all characterised by an integrated business model that enables their (social and/or environmental) mission to be realised through their direct business operations and not by business profits alone. Driven by the desire to find innovative solutions to systemic social problems and environmental challenges (local and global), social entrepreneurs have facilitated collaboration across traditional 'sectorial boundaries' (the public, private, and not-for-profit sectors) using business thinking to reach people in need and utilising markets for social good.  The aim of this course is to first introduce the key features of a social enterprise, examining the various, and at times contested, terminology used in social enterprise/social business contexts, and compare and contrast social enterprises to other enterprise forms (corporations, businesses, and charitable/benevolent organisations).  The course will then consider some of the challenges, constraints, and opportunities that social enterprises confront in pursuing their organisational mission (both social/environmental and financial) before examining how a social enterprise might be designed, launched, and scaled. In addition to developing foundational knowledge about social enterprises, the course will also focus on development presentation skills, in particular, how to pitch to potential investors an idea for 'doing business for social good'.",No Prerequisites,6 Units of Credit

This course is designed for non-computing majors who want a solid introduction to programming, with the aim of using computers as part of some other discipline. It does not assume any prior background in programming.
Electrical Engineering, Telecommunications, Mechanical Engineering, and Mechatronic Engineering specify this as the standard first year computing course. COMP1911 and the following course COMP1521 provide a solid introduction to programming an computer systems concepts for all of these students.
Students with an interest in computing or who wish to be extended might want to consider COMP1511 as an alternative, especially if they plan to study more computing as part of their future study. Students from all degrees are permitted to take COMP1511 instead of COMP1911.
Note: Because of significant content overlap, students cannot take both COMP1911 and COMP1511.","Prerequisite: Enrolment in a non-CSE major (no BINF, COMP, or SENG)",6 Units of Credit

COMP6721,Term 2 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"(In-)Formal Methods are practical structuring and design patterns that encourage programming that is easy to understand and to maintain. They are only a part of the large body of “good programming practices,” distinguished from that larger set because –for the methods we consider– the computer-science community has determined the science behind the structures: we know why they are effective.
Unusually, this course does not take the traditional route of teaching that science first, and then turning it into practical programming “tools-of-thought.” Instead, we teach the mental tools first, try them on examples and only then, once their effectiveness has been demonstrated, will we look behind the scenes to see where they come from.
Initially the material will deal with conventional programs, those that must “give the right output.” (This is known as functional correctness, and a sorting program is a simple example.) Later in the course we will look at additional correctness criteria, such as security (perform this calculation in a way that keeps part of the answer hidden) and randomisation (implement over-the-internet protocols that depend intrinsically on coin-flipping).

COMP6741,Term 3 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,1,"The course focuses on algorithms for exactly solving NP-hard computational problems. Since no polynomial time algorithm is known for any of these problems, the running time of the algorithms will have a super-polynomial dependence on the input size or some other parameter of the input.
The first part presents algorithmic techniques to solve NP-hard problems provably faster than brute-force in the worst case, such as branching algorithms, dynamic programming across subsets, inclusion-exclusion, local search, and measure & conquer. We will also see lower bounds for algorithms and how to rule out certain running times assuming the (Strong) Exponential Time Hypothesis.
Whereas the first part presents ""default"" algorithms that one would use without knowing much about the instances one is about to solve, the second part acknowledges that the complexity of an instance does not only depend on its size n. A parameter k is associated with each instance and the parameterized complexity framework aims at designing fixed-parameter algorithms whose running times are f(k)*poly(n) for a computable function f. This gives efficient algorithms for small values of the parameter obtained via techniques such as branching, colour coding, iterative compression, and kernelization (preprocessing).

This course provides an introduction to penology. It begins by considering the growing use of prisons across the developed world and is then constructed around three main themes: theorising the prison; perspectives for reform; and contemporary issues in Australian penal policy. The elective is designed to give students some insight into the frameworks used by social theorists to analyse imprisonment, with a view to examining contemporary issues such as ‘supermax’ prisons, deaths in custody, immigration detention, the civil rights of prisoners and prison privatisation. The experience of the New South Wales prison system following the 1978 Royal Commission into New South Wales prisons provides an immediate context for studying such issues and an opportunity to examine the complexities and limitations of prison reform.The course intends to focus on the wider sociological implications of imprisonment and to introduce students to the various perspectives on punishment and the prison system offered by social theorists. It is designed to encourage both a basic understanding of the core literature and the ability to apply different penological perspectives to original research.
A student who has successfully completed this course should be able to:understand some of the main themes within penology; understand the relationship of penology to criminology; appreciate the wider instrumental role of the prison in the criminal justice process; and contribute to more informed policy debate about prisons and punishment.",Prerequisite: 24 units of credit at Level 1 including CRIM1010 or CRIM1011,6 Units of Credit

This course examines the development of important institutions and procedures of criminal justice, and the debates they provoked from the 17th to the 19th century. Using early modern England as a focal point (but also referring to criminal justice in Europe), this course will introduce you to the major features of England’s criminal justice system. It asks: Why were so few criminals prosecuted and convicted in the 17th and 18th centuries? Why did punishments in this period – even for apparently minor crimes – seem to be so brutal and bloodthirsty? Why were executions carried out in public? We then consider some of the ways in which “reforms” were introduced during the 18th and 19th centuries: Why was the policy of transportation developed? What were the prison hulks? What changes were implemented in England’s prisons? How could the French Revolution’s famous innovation – the guillotine – be considered humane?

This course builds upon your understanding of the major theoretical approaches to crime and criminal justice, and seeks to answer the above questions. Criminological theory will be critically examined for its utility in developing policy responses and understanding the historical and contemporary development of our understandings of crime, criminality and the criminal justice system. Similar to other social sciences, criminology is a reflexive discipline whereby part of the criminological enterprise is to critically examine criminology itself.

Prisoners, community-based offenders, and other detainee groups exert huge, social, health and economic impacts on the community and pose significant challenges for society. Those in contact with the justice system endure some of the worst health outcomes in the community in terms of mental illness, substance misuse, traumatic brain injury and infectious diseases (e.g. HIV and viral hepatitis). Many of these can be attributed to the social determinants of health and lifestyle factors including injecting drug use, alcohol abuse, sexual risk behaviours, body piercing, tattooing and violence. Contact with the justice system, including incarceration, presents an important opportunity to intervene and improve health outcomes of hard-to-access populations.Significant overlap exists between public health and criminology in terms of offender rehabilitation as the criminogenic needs of this population are also public health priorities that operate in a complex legal, human rights, research, and policy environment. In this course you will learn about the complex health needs of those in contact with the justice system and the importance of these for offender rehabilitation. Experts in this field (e.g. a former prisoner, prison administrator, prison doctor and prisoner support worker) will present and discuss the challenges and controversies in prisoner and offender health (e.g. harm reduction strategies in prison, treatment of the mentally ill in the justice system), researching offenders, ethical dilemmas, health service delivery in prison, and prevention and intervention strategies. A visit to a prison will provide an opportunity to reflect on some of these issues.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in Criminology.

This course will introduce you to some of the many tools that can facilitate creative thinking. The processes of analysis can help to extend possibilities beyond predictable outcomes, and the same thinking tool can be used across many different disciplines to create new, more integrated and original options and ideas. We will explore visual, verbal and physical ways of transforming ordinary ideas into fantastic ones. Using taught techniques such as the Synectic Pinball Game you will learn to understand more clearly what happens when the creative mind is at work.
We will test the principles of interconnectivity, bisociation (conceptual blending), non-linear (associative) thinking, and use maps, models and metaphors to develop your creative thinking through research, analysis and application of these models to your own ideas. Many famous creative thinkers have used a wide range of processes that we will critically explore and apply.
An important part of understanding and applying the creative process is an examination of how we learn, and how to facilitate the best possible conditions and environments for working in innovative and creative ways. The balance between strategic planning and goal-free approaches to creative processes will be analysed and discussed in relation to the applied research of Professor Teresa Amabile and Professor Tina Seelig amongst others.

Research has consistently highlighted the competitive nature of the graduate recruitment process.  Results from the 2018 Australian Association of Graduate Employers Survey showed that major graduate employers receive over 1,000 applications each year. 
While academic performance is important, the majority of graduate employers rated teamwork, cultural fit and interpersonal skills as “very important” - much higher ratings than academic grades. In 2018, the next most valued attributes were communication, motivational fit and problem solving skills. The transferable skills developed outside the classroom in community engagement, casual work and relevant work placements are the major factors that differentiate the best candidates.

This course provides a treatment of the economic foundations of modern finance. We start with a discussion of how economic agents (should) make decisions when the economic environment is uncertain. Then, asset-pricing models are introduced, and we discuss how economic uncertainty can be dealt with using state-contingent securities, which in turn lead to efficient market outcomes when markets are complete. Further topics include option pricing, determination of firms' value and its relation to a firm's capital structure, and the theory of efficient portfolios.

ECON5130,Term 3 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"The central component of a modern economy is the financial system. Particularly since 1980s, the “financialisation” of the economies across the globe, with the unprecedented influence of capital markets and their intermediaries that this process has involved, has had increasingly visible effects on households and firms. Modern financial development, including innovations of financial instruments and institutes, has drastically increased the borrowing and savings opportunities of households, firms have now wider investment opportunities. However, there is also an increasing awareness that economies’ performances are now deeply interlinked and subject to greater economic volatility than in the past.
