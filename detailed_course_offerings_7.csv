Communication design: multimodality, meaning, and media
Communication tends to be thought of and analysed in terms of specific modes such as 'writing', 'image', or 'sound', and these are very often analysed in isolation from each other. But communication is never as clear-cut as that. Something as seemingly-straightforward as 'writing' in fact has a visual component (how it looks), and a material component (what it is produced on and with). And we also communicate through many other modes - such as through the design of objects and buildings, the sorts of networks we create through digital media, or the actions we undertake in daily life. In this course, you will extend your understanding of communication by investigating underlying principles of communication design, the range of modes we communicate with, and the complex nature of all forms of communication.

All students will enrol in MFAC 3501-3509 and may enrol in additional courses, depending on whether they have undertaken earlier individualised study programs or have been granted any exemptions.
Objectives: - By completion of Phase 3, students will be expected to demonstrate an integrated achievement of the eight desired capabilities specified as appropriate for graduates to practice as interns. These include a thorough understanding of the biomedical science mechanisms and bio-social determinants that maintain health, contribute to illness, and underlie appropriate management strategies; application of a scientific approach to clinical medicine and medical practice; excellent communicative, teamwork, psychomotor and cognitive skills to assess health issues and patient problems and develop patient-centred management approaches; and demonstrated abilities to work independently, reflectively and within appropriate ethical and legal frameworks.
Clinical learning in phase 3 will be predominantly located in clinical environments associated with the Faculty of Medicine in a range of metropolitan and rural locations throughout New South Wales. Most modules will be available in a variety of clinical locations and students will be able to select an individualised learning program from a menu offered by clinical teaching units, or they may be able to negotiate their program with their clinical supervisors. Students will generally be able to indicate a preference to do the majority of their clinical training attached to one geographical region, but final allocation will be determined by a number of factors including availability of attachments to particular locations, and is ultimately the responsibility and decision of the Faculty. 
Students are required to complete one each of six clinical modules with a specified major focus, these being in the clinical disciplines of Children's Health; Women's Health; Mental Health; Internal Medicine; Surgery; and Chronic & Complex Care, although some choice of the structure, case-mix and location of each of these will generally be possible. In addition to these specified modules, students may choose from a range of other available clinical modules to complete phase 3 requirements. The order and content of work undertaken in these courses will be organised for each student on an individual basis through the relevant Clinical School(s).
In considering their choice of modules in Phase 3, the student's clinical experience must include a minimum of 8 weeks in community or ambulatory settings, as well as 8 weeks experience of emergency or critical care, although these may be spread over one or more individual modules. In addition, a student's combined clinical experiences during phases 2 and 3 must include a minimum of 8 weeks in rural locations, 4 weeks in primary care practice and adequate exposure to various clinical sub-specialities. 
All clinical modules in phase 3 adopt the principles of clinical clerkship, in which students learn through experience and participation in the treatment of patients under the care of medical practitioners and/or medical teams to which they are attached. Although structured teaching activities are generally limited to an average of 10 hours per week, which will include teaching of relevant biomedical sciences and social sciences, students are required to work under supervision as part of the health care delivery unit. Students' responsibilities as part of the team will increase gradually as new skills are developed. Each module will have demonstrable links to those aspects of basic biomedical and social sciences relevant to the health issues encountered. 
Assessment for each module will focus on the performance of students relative to the desired graduate capabilities.

It will equip them with a number of theoretical concepts and engineering principles, as well as relevant, practical rock mechanics design tools. Specific areas covered in the course include: definition of a boundary value problem- equilibrium equations, constitutive models and boundary conditions; the theories and applications of Finite Element Method (FEM), Discrete Element Method (DEM) and Boundary Element Method (BEM) to mining engineering; practical use of a number of computational software packages.
The course is presented in the form of lectures, interactive discussions, tutorial and laboratory sessions and hands-on practical work with stress analysis packages. It will be presented by a number of specialists from both within the university and from external specialist consultants.","Prerequisite: Enrolment in MINEUS8059, or MINE8140 and enrolment in MINEIS8058 or MINEJS8335 or MINERS5335 or MINETS8059.",6 Units of Credit
MINE8760,Term 1 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",0,1,"This course will focus on the essential interaction between the disciplines of geology and mining engineering, embracing engineering geology, structural geology, the geotechnical field and applied geophysics within the constraints of ongoing mining operations - the need to operate safely, the need to maintain production and the need to control costs. The impact of engineering geological rock mass properties and structural features on mining operations is evaluated. The likely variability of these parameters and the degree of confidence with which they can be predicted and projected ahead of open pit and underground mining processes and hence used in ongoing mine planning and scheduling will be discussed. Techniques of determining and monitoring the stress regime of the mine will be reviewed.In this context, a major task of the mine geologist is to continually update the technical data base, originally based on exploration data, with new data gathered as mining proceeds and by logging of strategically placed drill holes in advance of mining. Results of and lessons learnt from mining operations must also be incorporated in the data base to assist in reinterpretation of the data and improve prediction of future mining conditions. Modern geophysical techniques are essential aids in this process. These techniques, including 2D and 3D seismic, microseismics, tomography, electromagnetic imaging techniques, radar and downhole geophysical survey methods, will be reviewed in the context of their ability to provide reliable information to assist with mine planning and operational decision making.
This course will enable students to gain knowledge and skills needed for effective communication between disciplines at the geological-engineering interface.

MMAN2100,Term 3 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"This course focuses on the subject of engineering design, which plays the role in guiding an engineer or a team of engineers to think like a designer along a systemic, rational, and creative pathway, towards breakthrough innovations of new product/service. This course provides students with a holistic understanding of the big picture, wide spectrum, and structured process of engineering design. In particular, it focuses on the early stage design, with respect to functional design and conceptual design, which greatly determines the ultimate success of any new product development.
Unlike the purely technical engineering subjects, engineering design is characterized by the synergy between “analysis” and “synthesis”, between “rationality” and “optimality”, as well as between “do the right thing” and “do the thing right”. Therefore, this course aims to make you understand the socio-technical nature of engineering design, and provide you with the capacity of not only solving a given design problem using relevant engineering knowledge, but also formulating a new design problem. 
Design thinking is a fundamental skill that every engineer must have for the 21st Century. It is one of the skills that profoundly distinguish human intelligence from artificial intelligence, which greatly impacts an engineer’s long-term career success in the workplace. Therefore, this course aims to equip you with the domain-independent and solution-neutral design thinking, which can be applied to whatever technical stream (e.g., aerospace, mechanical, manufacturing, mechatronic, or naval engineering) you choose to pursue in the future. 
Finally, today’s engineering problem is becoming too complex to be addressed by a single engineer based on separate disciplinary knowledge. Therefore, this course also aims to make you understand both opportunities and challenges of collaborative engineering design. Through the pedagogy of project-based learning, it’s expected that your collaborative communication, negotiation, and decision-making skills will be enhanced.",Pre-requisite: ENGG1000,6 Units of Credit

Music is part of the life of people everywhere, and as George Eliot once said, there is no feeling, except the extremes of fear and grief, that does not find relief in music. Universal though these truths might appear to be, the various musical expressions of the world’s peoples are as diverse, unique, and sometimes strange, as the natural and cultural worlds that make them. Today we can access that musical diversity easily. We can buy it, download it, iPod it. But just how much do we know about the peoples, histories, sentiments, and lives of the musicians and singers that produce this music? How much do we grasp the beauty, the yearning, and the spirituality in that music? What can we learn that will deepen our appreciation, understanding, and perhaps performance of the many musical expressions available to us today?
This World Music course surveys and examines the relationships between music, the society in which it is performed, and individual selves. It explores both traditional and contemporary music of Aboriginal Australia, South-east Asia, India, Central Asia and the Middle East, West Africa and the Caribbean, and marginal Europe. It examines how musical practices express, shape, and allow for the individual and collective construction and negotiation of identity, ethnicity, gender, spirituality and class. It investigates how transformations in music both as social practice and as sound chart responses to modernity, state intervention, globalisation, conflict, dispossession and migration. The course also fosters direct experience of music in diverse cultural contexts through field work.",Prerequisite: 24 units of credit at Level 1,6 Units of Credit

Any musicological investigation requires a sound understanding of sources and methods, and this course will provide you with that understanding. Since the course is core to the Musicology Stream, inquiry itself is the primary focus. The course therefore begins with questions: how do musicologists conceive of the music they listen to? how are those conceptions communicated to others? how do ideas about music change historically? what methods have been developed to hone musical ideas? The aim of musicology is always to persuade others of how you hear music, whether your approach to music is through biographical study, manuscript study (paleography, editions, publication history and considerations, marked scores), primary source study, analysis, organology, iconography, criticism, aesthetics, hermeneutics, reception history, performance studies, transcription, music psychology, or ethnography. To better understand hearing, we will study how others have listened to music, and how that listening has formed both musicological writing and newly created music.","Prerequisite: 36uoc in Level 1 Music courses, and enrolment in a Music single or dual degree program.

Since its beginnings around a century ago, jazz has consistently enthused listeners with the inventiveness, expressiveness and virtuosity of its performers, and the variety of its styles. Beginning with African American chants, field hollers, early blues and urban dance forms, this course traces a history of the music, outlining the development and details of various styles of jazz, both in the United States and abroad. Tracing the changing locations in which the music has developed, it examines the roles of individual artists and musical collectivities in the innovation of styles. It investigates the dissemination of jazz through emerging media technologies, and notes the influence of other music on jazz musicians: popular music, rhythm and blues, soul, rock, classical music and world music, such as Latin American music, French gypsy music, South African kwela and mbqanga. As jazz has become the scintillating soundtrack to many lives, the course examines both the practical use of jazz as sound and image in film, literature and the visual arts, and some of the many meanings listeners have ascribed to it. The course introduces you to critical debates surrounding jazz: debates of race, authenticity, ownership, gender and commercialization.

In this course you will learn some key methods of musical transformation. We will begin with orchestration, which transforms music for a single instrument into music that involves a stage full of performers. Orchestration also requires careful decisions about adding new materials, removing old material, adapting, multiplying, and spatialising musical ideas, all of which will be discussed in terms of historical models (including Mozart, Brahms, Wagner, and Adès, for example). The second part of the course revolves around a question: how have composers used old music to make new music? In answering this question we will focus on transformation itself, and we will examine in detail a wide range of recent re-compositions of earlier music (including Halvorsen, Ives, Berio, Schnittke, Nyman and Adams, for example). These will form models for your own re-compositions.","Prerequisite: MUSC1602, MUSC1603, MUSC1604 and MUSC2116",6 Units of Credit

NEUR3121,Term 1 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"This course provides an integrative approach to understanding cellular neuroscience. It begins with an understanding of cell membranes and the mathematical equations that describe the movement of ions. It then builds a repertoire of the key molecules that underlie the processes of signalling in neural cells. These are then combined to understand the behaviour of neural cell signalling and how these may be manipulated experimentally to understand the function. Topic areas include: how electrical signals are generated across cell membranes; the function, properties and structure of ion channels, receptors and transporters; how nerve cells communicate with each other in the brain, including synaptic transmission and receptor-mediated signalling; how alterations in function can lead to disease states; modern experimental techniques in cellular neuroscience; application of molecular biology techniques to manipulate and explore the function of molecules in the nervous system. The course provides an ideal introduction for further studies in neuroscience and pharmacology, and provides a foundation for the understanding of higher physiological systems.
