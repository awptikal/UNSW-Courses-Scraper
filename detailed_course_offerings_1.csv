How did the modern world happen? How did a few small countries in Europe (and later the United States) come to dominate so much of the world’s wealth and power by 1900? How did they displace the great empires of the Middle East, South Asia and China? Between 1400 and the beginning of the twentieth century, an astonishing, global revolution took place. We call it ‘modernity’. Human beings moved from villages to cities, from face-to-face communities to vast and bewilderingly complex societies. Nations and nation-states replaced the great empires and grand monarchies. Political ideologies and racism had become as deeply ingrained in people’s minds as the traditional religions. Towards the end, electricity and fossil fuels replaced human and animal muscle power, and machines drove peoples and things across the seas, over land and into the air. ARTS1270 Global History explains the making of the modern world to 1900.

This course can also be studied in the following specialisation: Asian Studies
Development is everywhere. Everyday, all over the world from small villages to entire regions, social, political, and economic changes take place in the name of development. Yet, what is development and why does it matter? In this course we think of development as change; change driven by particular ideas about what a good life should be. Communities all around the world are subject to policies and projects that seek to change their lives for the better. Some succeed, some do not. Some are designed locally, some are designed much further away. Some are the result of shared ideas about what makes human life better while others are challenges to the way things are and call for dramatic changes to society. In this course we explore what drives development interventions, the ways it impacts communities, and the ways they respond. 
Through a series of 10 questions that form the content of the 10 week course, you will learn why development thinking – and by extension development practices – has changed over time, and the extent to which its architects have learnt from past failure and successes. You will be exposed to a variety of geographic case studies to see how development works (or doesn't) on the ground. You will leave this course with an appreciation about the complexities of development and with a solid foundation of what has been learned from past failures and successes.",No Prerequisites,6 Units of Credit

Contemporary Europe in Crisis: Power and Culture explores the unprecedented challenges facing contemporary Europe, through academic analysis, political commentary, film and novels. The processes of economic and political integration, heralded by the European Union, are under existential threat, and nationalism is on the rise. To the west, British disaffection with perceived loss of sovereignty has led to a referendum passing 'Brexit', indicating the intention of a member state to leave the EU for the first time. To its south, Europe is dealing with a refugee crisis brought on by wars in north Africa and the Middle East. On its Eastern flank, tensions with Russia are heightened, especially over Ukraine. The relationship of Europe with the USA in the era of Donald Trump's presidency is also in flux. All this is taking place while Europe has been reeling from the global financial crisis, with stringent austerity measures in some countries leading to great social deprivation and political unrest. This has created a resurgent right wing, which blames Europe's ills on immigrant populations, especially the Islamic community. Europe pressingly seeks to reconcile its liberal and secular ideals with the competing demands of nationalism and religious fundamentalism.

ARTS1810,Term 1 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"Subject Area: Politics and International Relations
Where does power lie in politics? Whose explanations about how the world works are valued and why? This course will equip you with some of the skills necessary to begin formulating your own answers to these questions. You will be introduced to the idea of studying politics, both domestic and international, as an academic discipline, and to some of the key academic conventions and standards that are important to the discipline: the idea of evidence-based argument, for example, and the idea of ethical scholarship. We will also discuss the formation of the modern state system and interrogate the conceptualisation of the state that informs much contemporary theory and practice in politics at the national and international level.
A substantial part of this course is devoted to the introduction of the main theoretical traditions that animate the study of politics and international relations. One of the central messages of the course is that different theoretical approaches generate different images of the world that build on particular assumptions. Therefore, while people may think they know what the current problems of politics and global politics are and how to solve them, one of the aims of this course is to alert you to other ways of seeing things. This should allow you to make a more confident decision about your own stance towards particular issues and to analyse these issues more thoroughly, but it should also make you question both your own and others’ representations of the world.",No Prerequisites,6 Units of Credit

In doing so, the course also introduces you to some of the different ways in which Politics and International Relations scholars seek to analyse these issues, giving you the opportunity to develop the skills of analysis needed for more advanced study in Politics and International Relations. At the conclusion of the course, you will have developed an appreciation of the scope and significance of the study of contemporary global politics, and some of the strengths and limitations of existing ways of analysing some of the most pressing problems facing the world.",No Prerequisites,6 Units of Credit

This course introduces you to the wave of experimentation in the arts that we have come to call modernism. During the first forty or so years of the twentieth century, traditional art forms underwent an unprecedented process of revolution and innovation, as artists and writers sought radically new ways to express the experience of modernity. We will consider the works of a range of individual European and North American modernist writers and film-makers, as well as examining some of the many collective movements, groupuscules and “isms” that sprang up during this period. A touchstone of our inquiry will be the vexed relationship between “modernity” as a historical condition and “modernism” as a cultural movement. What does it mean to be modern? What happens to art when traditional beliefs and ways of life enter a period of permanent crisis – a  period, that is, when “all that is solid melts into air”? And does modernist culture teach us ways to feel at home in modernity, or does it remind us of our alienation?",Prerequisite: 24 units of credit at Level 1,6 Units of Credit

In 1820, the poet Goethe coined the term ‘world literature’ as an expansive way of thinking about the circulation of texts around the globe, and the new forms of being in the world that were being traced by them. Two centuries later, Goethe’s phrase is taking centre-stage again, speaking to the very different globalised present of our own time.  Taking a range of compelling literary texts (contemporary novels, poetry and drama) as a starting point, this course invites you to explore this notion of ‘world literature’ and to investigate related ideas of literary ‘world systems’ and global structures of literary production, translation and recognition.   You will think in some detail about literary language, form and genre as a way of first approaching formulations of the ‘local’ and ‘locality’, and then establishing related questions of diverse cultural, linguistic and literary contexts. 
 The course is organised into two modules: ‘Water’ and ‘Land’. This geographical focus will support the scope of your reading and foster discussion within and across certain formulations of the ‘world’ literary canon.  You will think about questions of global movement and situated belonging, as well as current literary engagements with areas of urgent concern: vulnerable bodies, territorial conflict, ecology, the city and the animating question of global centres and peripheries.

Film genres are more than the mechanism of classification based on subject matter that we associate with the western, the horror film, the musical, etc. From producers to consumers, from studio moguls to directors, to critics, fans and aficionados, the notion of genre is used as a key determinant of a film’s meaning. Genre films work within and have the opportunity to reflect on society’s primary myths of identity and individuality, freedom and responsibility, cultural stability and social change. This course will consider some of the most fascinating questions raised by genre films: What are the parameters for standardization and innovation within film genres?

In particular, you will develop the ability to navigate the relationship between two sorts of ‘play': a script and a performance. The course combines exercises in literary analysis of written text, with a consideration of performance conventions and signification in theatre production. Through a lecture series and seminars that incorporate rehearsed readings and evidence from productions, you will become familiar with a broad range of highly-regarded plays from antiquity to the present day. You will investigate the relationship of these plays to the contexts in which they were first staged and to our contemporary world. You will also have opportunities to analyse and intervene in the processes of canon formation.

The election of Donald Trump to the United States presidency highlights gaping rifts in the society and politics of the contemporary United States. Decades of increasing inequality, globalisation and cultural conflict between religious conservatives, libertarians and what Americans call 'liberals' have left American politics and society more divided than it has been for half a century. At the same time, the United States remains the world's greatest power, exercising an enormous say in global governance, from economics to the environment. This course explores key elements in the making of Trump's America. Focusing particularly on the peculiar 20th-century US histories of class, race, religion and global engagement, you will learn how the world's oldest liberal democracy has become such a vital and fraught force in the contemporary world.",Prerequisite: 24 units of credit at Level 1,6 Units of Credit

In this course you will study the history of British colonialism and the movement for independence in India, focussing on the key question: if the struggle for freedom in India was conducted along Gandhian lines according to the principles of non-violence, then how can we understand the extent of violence that accompanied decolonisation, in 1947? The course answers this question by moving beyond the dominant tropes of the British Raj, replete with civilising missions, bejewelled maharajas and tiger hunts, to present a critical interrogation of colonial dynamics, demonstrating the relationships between imperial oppression, anti-colonial violence and Gandhian nonviolence, which culminated in the independence of India and the creation of East and West Pakistan, in 1947. The course engages with narratives of imperialism embedded in contemporary and historical popular cultures, from Raj Nostalgia to Bollywood film, seeking to align these with academic and public debates about history. We will reflect on the legacies of violence and nonviolence in India, and on the enduring impact of imperialism in the region.",Prerequisite: 24 units of credit at Level 1,6 Units of Credit

This course focuses on interactions among China, Korea, and Japan; their relations with the West; and the issue of culture and civilization in the post-nation-state era. The course is organized thematically. It starts by framing East Asia in terms of its history of globalization through cultural and religious interaction. The course then turns to fundamental cultural commonalities centring on statecraft, institutions, education and notions of civilization that united and divided the region. Cross cultural comparisons among China, Japan, and Korea highlight the global and regional dimensions of cultural change in East Asia. These frame cultural similarities and differences that influenced the varying approaches to modernity taken by Chinese, Japanese and Korean activists when East Asia came under increasing pressure from the West. The formation of nation-state ideologies along Western lines led to evolving conceptions of their place in the world, the meaning of culture, the role of commerce, and the relationship of the individual to the state. But in the era of globalization, these issues are situated in a post-nation-state framework.
The course thus concludes with East Asia's contributions to globalization.This course is taught in English and with readings in English.",Prerequisite: 24 units of credit at Level 1,6 Units of Credit

This course can also be studied in the following specialisation: Development Studies
Human society has experienced remarkable change as technological innovation, economic growth and population have produced rapidly changing social and environmental landscapes over the past current centuries. Such development is often seen a synonym of progress; however, over the past few decades it has been increasingly recognised that such rapid change has produced an uneven social geography – marginalising significant populations – while also intensively degrading and polluting different environments. We will discuss how the idea of sustainable development has emerged as a response to this conundrum – an effort to redirect economic growth to produced more socially just and environmentally benign outcomes. The path to a sustainable future, however, is not straightforward, as environmental, social and economic issues are ultimately situated in contested political realms. In this course, you will study how human-environment interconnections, across different scales and in different contexts, come together to demonstrate how environmental issues are situated in, and shaped by political and economic contexts. This will include engaging with a number of key sustainability debates as well as the in-depth study of different examples from around the world.",Prerequisite: 24 units of credit at Level 1,6 Units of Credit

Climate change is often understood as primarily a scientific or environmental problem that requires economic or technological solutions. In this course we will explore how climate change is perhaps better understood as a social, cultural and political phenomenon which is remaking the ways in which we understand our relationship with the Earth. How we understand climate, weather, nature and the environment are crucial for understanding contemporary global warming and our responses to it. We will examine the underlying politics of climate change. You will garner a conceptual and methodological toolkit for interpreting and making sense of the social aspects of climate change and the often intense political arguments that surround it. The course explores the history of climate science and the more recent emergence of a global consensus on anthropogenic global warming. The course goes on to consider recent work on abrupt climate change, climate modelling and the politics of climate change adaptation and mitigation technologies. The course draws on a multi-disciplinary framework for understanding the social, historical and political aspects of climate change, with insights from politics, sociology, and science and technical studies (STS).

Nothing is more human than to think that reality gives us knowledge. Nothing is more human than to wonder what, if anything, is real. When philosophy seeks to understand these fundamental and vital aspects of people and the world, we gain both an epistemology and a metaphysics. Some metaphysical topics that the course might explore include these: what it is to be a person; what it is to have a free will (if indeed anyone ever does); whether there is, or even could be, a supremely good and knowing and powerful god; whether there is any meaning to human life; whether there is any harm in death as such; and what makes two different individual things able to be examples of one kind of thing. Some epistemological issues that the course might explore include these: what it is for a thought or claim to be true; what it is for a thought or claim to be rationally well supported; what it is for a thought or claim to be knowledge; what it is to have knowledge via the senses; what it is to have knowledge purely via reason; and whether it might be impossible for us ever to have any knowledge or rational support at all.",Prerequisite: 24 units of credit at Level 1,6 Units of Credit

Sex is a constant through time, but ‘sexuality’ has a history. By starting in the Ancient world, you will learn that people and societies have not always understood sexual behaviour to equate with a sexual identity, such as ‘homosexual’ or ‘heterosexual’. ‘Sexuality’ then is a modern phenomenon. To comprehend this, we will examine why masturbation suddenly became a very big ‘problem’ in the 18th century and why sex was increasingly regulated from the 19th century. We chart the growth of new forms of sexual knowledge and ponder feminist critiques of Freud and other sex ‘experts’. We wind up in the twentieth century, with not one but several sexual revolutions.

Jane Austen currently enjoys a cultural popularity rivaling that of Shakespeare. This course aims to take account of the abiding relevance of Austen's work in the early 21st century in two distinct but related ways. On the one hand, it focuses on Austen's juvenilia and novels as social and cultural products of their time. It examines how her works interact self-consciously with contemporary romantic, gothic and sentimental fiction as well as 'converse' with each other to form a dynamic and intellectually challenging body of work. On a more theoretical level, it explores the various components of Austen's literary style that allow her to speak to present-day readers: her use of irony, her ability to illuminate the subtle transformation of character over time, and her unique intermingling of romance and realism. Through these two lenses, the module demonstrates the continuing relevance of Austen's literary and moral worldview.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, English",6 Units of Credit

What do you want to be when you grow up? At some point during the eighteenth century, this question went from being more or less meaningless to one of the central preoccupations of Western literature and culture: the driving principle of countless—if not most—classic novels, and the occasion for many canonical works in other genres and media. The idea that the shape of an individual life follows a basic pattern of development, leading from the open-ended possibility of youth to the stable identity of adulthood, seems self-evident to us, but this idea has a history: it has been figured, configured and reconfigured in many different ways over the past 250 years, and continues to mutate and develop under our eyes today. The aim of this course is to track the related ideas of youth, adulthood and development over this period, as they are represented in key works of literature and cinema, and especially within the genre of the Bildungsroman. Our inquiry will be guided by the assumption that narratives of development, in prose, poetry and film, are not only passive reflections of reality, but rather that these literary and film representations are essential tools for making sense of our time-bound lives. Accordingly, your engagement with these questions will take the form of class discussion and a traditional essay, but also an original narrative in which you implement your understanding of the genre. The course is designed as a history of ideas and representations, but also as a toolkit, which will help us think about what it means to come of age in our own society and how best to approach the problem of education.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, English",6 Units of Credit

The famous 20th Century philosopher Gilles Deleuze wrote in his books on cinema that ‘it is not sufficient to compare the great directors of cinema with painters, architects or even musicians. They must be compared to thinkers’. But what does it mean to think cinematically? In the wake of the decline of film theory as the unifying methodology of the discipline of film studies and the emergence of film-philosophy as one of several new approaches, this course identifies the question of the nature of film’s thought as a concern that dates back to the inception of cinema. Focusing on the kinds of ‘thinking’ undertaken by some of the ‘great directors’ in the history of cinema—including work by Eisenstein, Chaplin, Hitchcock, Dreyer, Welles, Rossellini, Sirk, Kubrick, Tarkovsky, Von Trier, and Malick—the course will introduce you to the diversity of contemporary approaches to the question of cinematic thinking (psychoanalytic, cognitivist, semiotic, philosophical) and to the work of the two most eminent philosophers of film: Stanley Cavell and Gilles Deleuze. A large part of the course will be devoted to reading key sections of Deleuze’s ambitious study Cinema 1: The Movement-Image and Cinema 2: The Time-Image and working through his major theses.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, Film Studies",6 Units of Credit

Media and climate change have had a long, entangled relationship. Media play key roles in the sciences of climate change themselves. For example, climate change sciences use computer modelling extensively, and also rely on global media networks that both circulate environmental data and allow for collaboration and discussion among scientists. Media also play a role in bringing climate change science to the public. In the process, media help frame the way climate change is discussed. Media thus play a fascinating if often conflicted series of roles in setting key social and political agendas with regard to climate change. On the other hand, dealing with climate change has challenged the way that media work. The mainstream media has had to change its approach to what counts as news, and to the way it sets agendas. Journalists have had to grapple with complex science in new ways. At the same time, newer media technologies such as social media and blogging platforms have augmented and often by-passed more traditional media platforms. This has transformed communications around environmental issues such as climate change. All this has created an increasingly complex setting both for the communication of science and for political communication around issues such as climate change. You will gain insight into the history, present and future of the increasingly important relations between media and climate change.

From election campaigns to radicalisation; from transnational personal relationships to gaming; from the constitution of the global economy to online dating; media technologies play a crucial role. They have the potential to create social and political change as well as to disrupt personal lives in ways unimaginable a decade or so ago.
In this course you will examine current, ‘live’ topics in media, using relevant concepts and frameworks to investigate and understand present-day media-related issues. During the course, you will be encouraged  to capture and study media-related events and developments as they unfold. At the beginning of the semester three to four significant, exemplary, on-going topics, news stories, or developments involving the media will be chosen. The rest of the semester, including lectures and tutorial readings and discussions, will be organised around two to three broad themes that are based on the chosen topics.
The key focus will be on the application of relevant theories, frameworks and concepts on these topics, and an exploration of appropriate methodologies for their analysis. The topics covered could include, for instance, digital media affordances, political communication as public strategy, online radicalisation, social media use and counter-publics, the political economy of IT industries, or surveillance and security, covering the themes of media in the public domain and media in the private domain, as well as the intersections of the two. The methodologies discussed could, in turn, include textual analysis and deconstruction, auto-ethnography, and conjunctural analysis. The emphasis will be on situating media analysis and theory within broader socio-cultural and political contexts.","Prerequisite: 48 uoc overall, including 6 uoc at level 1 and 6 uoc at level 2 in one of the following streams, MCT.

What makes contemporary Spain such a fascinating place is the immense and frenetic change it has undergone and that has, many argue, produced a new country. In less than half a century, a predominantly rural, agricultural society has been transformed into a mainly urban and technological one. A 40-year dictatorship has become a democracy. One of the world's most centralised states has been made into one of the most decentralised. A society that was intensely sexually repressed has become a notably permissive one. There has been a revolution in the roles of men and women. And, Spain has experienced a surge in immigration that has turned it, in the space of just a few years, into a multi-ethnic society. In this context of change, the topics explored in the course include nationalism and national identity, literary production, the arts, media, gender and sexuality, Europeanisation, languages and regionalism, religion, and fiestas.

Are you interested in understanding and tackling important environment-development challenges in the 21st century?

The course exposes you to a sophisticated understanding of the current development and environment issues affecting the well-being of local communities in Australia and developing countries. Specifically, the course provides you with the necessary theoretical background as well as a set of case studies to understand and tackle real-world environmental and development challenges. Through this course, you will have an opportunity to integrate social, economic and environmental aspects of development and environmental issues, and the concepts are discussed through the lens of sustainable development from a societal perspective. Ideas and issues are presented as contested entities because of the multiplicity of diverse, and at times, diametrically opposed stakeholder interests. The approach of the course, therefore, eschews the “one right way” approach to development and environment management in favour of an approach based on understanding the diverse and complex societal contexts in which development and environment professionals operate. Different approaches to managing the environment and development projects and programs are illustrated throughout by means of relevant case studies. You will be able to explore whether and how different policies and practices are working (or not working), and how policy responses can be made more equitable and sustainable at the community level.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, Development Studies",6 Units of Credit

Germany has faced enormous challenges and undergone radical transformations since the end of the Second World War, when it was a defeated, occupied pariah with no central government. For forty years, the country was divided into communist East and capitalist West, until the fall of the Berlin Wall heralded the end of the Cold War. Since then, Germany has arguably become the European Union's leading power. This course explores social, cultural and political developments in Germany since 1945, with a focus on major contemporary and scholarly debates. You will learn about how Germans in the postwar period coped with defeat and occupation and sought a new beginning; and about social, political and generational change in East and West Germany, including the challenge of radical leftwing terrorism since the 1970s. You will also explore the difficulties of uniting East and West Germans since 1990; how Germany has handled the arrival and integration of migrants and refugees; and the country's ongoing quest to define its national identity and its role in Europe and the world.

ARTS3783 examines the foreign policies of a number of great and emerging powers, including the United States, China, India, Britain and France from 1945 to the present. In doing so, it focuses on the problems, threats and challenges that confronted these powers during the Cold War and in the period following the collapse of the old bipolar system; it assesses how these powers perceived these problems, threats and challenges, how they reacted to them and what policies they put in place to offset them. In addition, ARTS3783 analyses the geopolitical, military, economic and domestic constraints under which these powers acted and considers the economic and military capabilities they relied on in pursuance of their foreign policy objectives.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, Development Studies, International Relations, Politics, or Politics and International Relations",6 Units of Credit

Has Germany 'come to terms' with its Nazi past? How are Stalinism and the Soviet Union remembered in Putin's Russia? In this course you will explore how Europeans have coped with their recent pasts, particularly the experiences of fascism and Nazism, of World War II and the Holocaust, and of Soviet-style communism. You will be introduced to the interdisciplinary fields of 'transitional justice' and 'memory studies' in the context of contemporary Europe. You will examine attempts to achieve justice, to identify perpetrators, victims, collaborators and bystanders, to reconcile former enemies and ideological opponents, and to develop new, usable understandings of the past. You will study the many ways in which the past is addressed, including though trials and purges, through commemoration rituals, memorials, museums and monuments, through official histories and popular memories, as well as the public and scholarly debates that surround them. The course draws on cases from across Europe, including France, Germany, Poland, Russia and Spain, and considers the role of the European Union.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, European Studies or History; or 48 UOC overall, including 12 UOC in German Studies language courses",6 Units of Credit

The period from the early 1970s is often noted as a particularly volatile one for the global political economy (GPE). This volatility has significant implications for the ways in which we are able, or not, to live our lives today and for the future sustainability of political-economic practice. You will be asked in this course to work out what these implications are, and how they have arisen, by examining the global political economy in a variety of forms, and through multiple perspectives. You will be encouraged to think reflectively and imaginatively about questions in the GPE for which there are no easy answers, including questions of power, privilege, common sense, instability and the ongoing role of crisis-driven capitalist growth. You will be asked to make decisions about your views on the apparently systemic nature of capitalist instability. Together, we will decide to what extent, and why, the global political economy has been dominated by crisis, developing an understanding of the structure and practices of global political-economic relations, in historical and contemporary perspective.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, Development Studies, International Relations, Politics, or Politics and International Relations",6 Units of Credit

Are emerging threats to international security really 'new'? If so, how should security studies scholars analyse them, and what are the implications for security praxis? How are policymakers dealing with these emerging or 'new' security challenges, to what effect, and what are some of the alternatives? These are some of the key questions explored in this course, which investigates the broad and evolving agenda of security studies, and key themes and dynamics in contemporary security relations. Using a range of conceptual and theoretical frameworks, the course asks you to examine issues such as new forms of warfare, sexualized violence in armed conflict, migration and identity, food security, climate change, and nuclear proliferation, and question whether these constitute 'new' security challenges. It asks what the implications of such an approach are for security relations at the state-societal level; the scholarly field of security studies, and the practice of security in policymaking terms. You are required to have a good level of familiarity with key security theories and concepts.

In this course, you examine this question from a Politics and International Relations perspective, examining processes of, and the actors involved in, political change. From the #metoo movement, to Black Lives Matter, to the Alt Right, to the Arab spring protests and Occupy and Indignado movements: all around the world citizens are mobilising, some because they want political change, others because they want to maintain the status quo. What is change? Why do some people want radical and others moderate change? What explains the success of advocates for non-change, i.e. the status quo? What kind of change do political actors seek to achieve? In this course you will further explore these questions comparing processes of political change and actors involved in generating political change in Australia and other countries around the world. You will learn about the role of power, legitimacy, and insider and outsider positions in making political change work (or not).

This seminar focuses on cultural identities – national, ethnic, religious and linguistic – in particular, and examines a range of scholarly and public debates provoked by these identities in seeming conflict. How should cultural identity fit within democratic states? Is the diversity associated with such identities compatible with the social solidarity needed for citizens to support collective goals like welfare programs? Do so-called nation-states have a right to protect their national identities and culture through restrictive immigration policies? Are liberal democratic states obliged to recognise the cultural identities and practices of its minorities? Should Indigenous groups be distinguished from immigrant groups? Should religious identity be treated differently from ethnic identity? Is multiculturalism bad for women, children, and animals? Should citizenship still be the foundation for addressing identity claims in democracies? By exploring how identities are constituted and situated in today’s highly mobile and interconnected world, this course asks how these identities shape world politics and offers you the opportunity to think carefully and reflectively about the relationship between various markers of identity and pressing questions in contemporary politics.

ARTS3822,Term 1 2019,"Main Campus, Kensington",1,0,"Subject Area: Politics and International Relations
The systematic study of politics has a long history, stretching back some two and a half thousand years to the ancient Greeks. Over the last century, however, it has become institutionalised and professionalised and, as the disciplinary name Political Science suggests, has sought to put the study of politics on a footing comparable to the aims, methods, and conventions presumed integral to the natural sciences. Yet the possibility, desirability, and even meaning of a “science of politics” are controversial issues. This course examines fundamental questions about what political knowledge is and how it is acquired. In the first weeks, you will explore in a general way what it might mean to be a “student of politics.” You will learn about the different fields of political science and examine the idea of a systematic and dispassionate study of anything. You will consider the modern history of the discipline and identify the different and often conflicting perspectives regarding the appropriate aims, scope, and methods of political inquiry. Thereafter, the course will proceed each week by examining in detail a particular analytical perspective in conjunction with a real-world case study: behaviouralism, marxism, interpretivism, institutionalism, rational choice theory, the structure versus agency problem, the relation between institutions, values and culture, and normative approaches.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, Politics and International Relations",6 Units of Credit

This course explores the rise of human rights discourse and its relationship to other discourses on suffering and social justice. It focuses on the experience of victims of human rights abuse and the politics of meaning. Students will engage in critiques of law as a reductionist discourse on the social by exploring the relationships between human rights and cultural differences such as gender, ethnicity, religion and indigenous cultures. The embodied self, social interdependency and the architecture of social institutions are the backdrop through which the course explores the tensions between universal and relativist understandings of human rights and their realization. Students will be introduced to the fundamentals of human rights, the global human rights machinery, and the ethics of humanitarian intervention, and will consider how sociologists and anthropologists have studied and written about human rights.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, Australian Studies, Development Studies, Globalisation Studies, orSociology & Anthropology",6 Units of Credit

In this course you will reflect on the practice of key social research methods for investigating culture and society. You will address the relationship between methods and methodology and recognise the importance of understanding the historical, theoretical and philosophical contexts from which particular research methods have emerged. Social researchers do not apply a set of neutral techniques to the issues they investigate, but rather research is part of a dynamic, engagement with social and cultural worlds with often deep connections to colonial thought and power. A heightened sense of the strategies used in researching culture and society enhances reflexivity among social researchers: that is, the capacity to reflect upon who we are, what we are doing; and the ethics of accountability. You will find that central to this course is the proposition that social research is a form of intervention in the social and cultural world, which may have major consequences on people’s lives. So too you will develop an understanding of your ‘subjective positioning’ and will come to find ways to decolonise your practice both through methods and methodologies. To do this you will engage with a wide source of information and knowledge and address decolonising principles and praxis.","Prerequisite: 48 UOC overall, including 6 UOC at level 1 and 6 UOC at level 2 in one of the following streams, Australian Studies, Development Studies, or Sociology & Anthropology",6 Units of Credit

Wars, occupations, cultural conflict and survival are features of the 21st century, affecting collective existence as well as the most intimate dimensions of personal life. This course provides you with an understanding of the complex social and cultural dimensions of violence, conflict, social trauma, and reconstruction and reconciliation efforts. Individualized representations of violent events dominate medical and juridical rationalities, human rights practices and truth commissions, but this course will insist too on the collective and cultural nature of trauma. You will engage with a range of sources - ethnographic, literary, narrative, cinematic, musical and artistic – and you will be introduced to the ways scholars have theorized the experience and aftermath of mass violence, state terror, genocide and torture.
